<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_11">HOLY IRELAND</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We had</span> hiked seventeen miles that stormy
December day—the third of a four days’
journey. The snow was piled high on our packs,
our rifles were crusted with ice, the leather of our
hob-nailed boots was frozen stiff over our lamed
feet. The weary lieutenant led us to the door of a
little house in a side street.</p>

<p>“Next twelve men,” he said. A dozen of us
dropped out of the ranks and dragged ourselves
over the threshold. We tracked snow and mud over
a spotless stone floor. Before an open fire stood
Madame and the three children—a girl of eight
years, a boy of five, a boy of three. They stared
with round frightened eyes at <i lang="fr">les soldats Americains</i>,
the first they had ever seen. We were too
tired to stare back. We at once climbed to the chill
attic, our billet, our lodging for the night. First we
lifted the packs from one another’s aching shoulders;
then, without spreading our blankets, we lay
down on the bare boards.</p>

<p>For ten minutes there was silence, broken by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
occasional groan, an oath, the striking of a match.
Cigarettes glowed like fireflies in a forest. Then a
voice came from the corner.</p>

<p>“Where is Sergeant Reilly?” it said. We lazily
searched. There was no Sergeant Reilly to be
found.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet the old bum has gone out after a pint,”
said the voice. And with the curiosity of the American
and the enthusiasm of the Irish we lumbered
downstairs in quest of Sergeant Reilly.</p>

<p>He was sitting on a low bench by the fire. His
shoes were off and his bruised feet were in a pail of
cold water. He was too good a soldier to expose
them to the heat at once. The little girl was on his
lap and the little boys stood by and envied him.
And in a voice that twenty years of soldiering and
oceans of whisky had failed to rob of its Celtic
sweetness, he was softly singing “Ireland isn’t Ireland
any more.” We listened respectfully.</p>

<p>“They cheer the King and then salute him,” said
Sergeant Reilly.</p>

<p>“A regular Irishman would shoot him,” and we
all joined in the chorus, “Ireland isn’t Ireland any
more.”</p>

<p>“Ooh, la, la!” exclaimed Madame, and she and all
the children began to talk at the top of their voices.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
What they said Heaven knows, but the tones were
friendly, even admiring.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Sergeant Reilly from his post
of honor, “the lady who runs this billet is a very nice
lady indeed. She says yez can all take off your
shoes and dry your socks by the fire. But take
turns and don’t crowd or I’ll trun yez all upstairs.”</p>

<p>Now Madame, a woman of some forty years, was
a true <i lang="fr">bourgeoise</i>, with all the thrift of her class.
And by the terms of her agreement with the authorities
she was required to let the soldiers have for one
night the attic of her house to sleep in—nothing
more; no light, no heat. Also, wood is very expensive
in France—for reasons that are engraven in
letters of blood on the pages of history. <span class="locked">Nevertheless—</span></p>

<p>“Assez-vous, s’il vous plait,” said Madame. And
she brought nearer to the fire all the chairs the establishment
possessed and some chests and boxes to be
used as seats. And she and the little girl, whose
name was Solange, went out into the snow and came
back with heaping armfuls of small logs. The fire
blazed merrily—more merrily than it had blazed
since August, 1914, perhaps. We surrounded it,
and soon the air was thick with steam from our drying
socks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame and the Sergeant had generously
admitted all eleven of us into their conversation.
A spirited conversation it was, too, in spite of
the fact that she knew no English and the extent of
his French was “du pain,” “du vin,” “cognac” and
“bon jour.” Those of us who knew a little more of
the language of the country acted as interpreters
for the others. We learned the names of the children
and their ages. We learned that our hostess
was a widow. Her husband had fallen in battle just
one month before our arrival in her home. She
showed us with simple pride and affection and restrained
grief his picture. Then she showed us
those of her two brothers—one now fighting at
Salonica, the other a prisoner of war—of her
mother and father, of herself dressed for First Communion.</p>

<p>This last picture she showed somewhat shyly, as
if doubting that we would understand it. But when
one of us asked in halting French if Solange, her
little daughter, had yet made her First Communion,
then Madame’s face cleared.</p>

<p>“Mais oui!” she exclaimed. “Et vous, ma foi,
vous etes Catholiques, n’est-ce pas?”</p>

<p>At once rosary beads were flourished to prove our
right to answer this question affirmatively. Tattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
prayer-books and somewhat dingy scapulars
were brought to light. Madame and the children
chattered their surprise and delight to each other,
and every exhibit called for a new outburst.</p>

<p>“Ah, le bon S. Benoit! Ah, voilà, le Conception
Immacule! Ooh la la, le Sacre Coeur!” (which last
exclamation sounded in no wise as irreverent as it
looks in print).</p>

<p>Now other treasures, too, were shown—treasures
chiefly photographic. There were family groups,
there were Coney Island snapshots. And Madame
and the children were a gratifyingly appreciative
audience. They admired and sympathized; they
exclaimed appropriately at the beauty of every
girl’s face, the tenderness of every pictured mother.
We had become the intimates of Madame. She had
admitted us into her family and we her into ours.</p>

<p>Soldiers—American soldiers of Irish descent—have
souls and hearts. These organs (if the soul
may be so termed) had been satisfied. But our
stomachs remained—and that they yearned was evident
to us. We had made our hike on a meal of
hardtack and “corned willy.” Mess call would
sound soon. Should we force our wet shoes on
again and plod through the snowy streets to the
temporary mess-shack? We knew our supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
wagons had not succeeded in climbing the last hill
into town, and that therefore bread and unsweetened
coffee would be our portion. A great depression
settled upon us.</p>

<p>But Sergeant Reilly rose to the occasion.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, “this here lady has got a good fire
going, and I’ll bet she can cook. What do you say
we get her to fix us up a meal?”</p>

<p>The proposal was received joyously at first.
Then someone said:</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got any money.” “Neither have
I—not a damn sou!” said another. And again the
spiritual temperature of the room fell.</p>

<p>Again Sergeant Reilly spoke:</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any money to speak of, meself,”
he said. “But let’s have a show-down. I guess
we’ve got enough to buy somethin’ to eat.”</p>

<p>It was long after pay-day, and we were not hopeful
of the results of the search. But the wealthy
(that is, those who had two francs) made up for the
poor (that is, those who had two sous). And
among the coins on the table I noticed an American
dime, an English half-crown and a Chinese piece
with a square hole in the center. In negotiable
tender the money came in all to eight francs.</p>

<p>It takes more money than that to feed twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
hungry soldiers these days in France. But there
was no harm in trying. So an ex-seminarian, an ex-bookkeeper
and an ex-street-car conductor aided
Sergeant Reilly in explaining in French that had
both a brogue and a Yankee twang that we were
hungry, that this was all the money we had in the
world, and that we wanted her to cook us something
to eat.</p>

<p>Now Madame was what they call in New England
a “capable” woman. In a jiffy she had the
money in Solange’s hand and had that admirable
child cloaked and wooden-shod for the street, and
fully informed as to what she was to buy. What
Madame and the children had intended to have for
supper I do not know, for there was nothing in the
kitchen but the fire, the stove, the table, some shelves
of dishes and an enormous bed. Nothing in the way
of a food cupboard could be seen. And the only
other room of the house was the bare attic.</p>

<p>When Solange came back she carried in a basket
bigger than herself these articles: 1, two loaves of
war-bread; 2, five bottles of red wine; 3, three
cheeses; 4, numerous potatoes; 5, a lump of fat; 6,
a bag of coffee. The whole represented, as was
afterward demonstrated, exactly the sum of ten
francs, fifty centimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Well, we all set to work peeling potatoes. Then,
with a veritable French trench-knife Madame cut
the potatoes into long strips. Meanwhile Solange
had put the lump of fat into the big black pot that
hung by a chain over the fire. In the boiling grease
the potatoes were placed, Madame standing by with
a big ladle punched full of holes (I regret that I do
not know the technical name for this instrument)
and keeping the potato-strips swimming, zealously
frustrating any attempt on their part to lie lazily at
the bottom of the pot.</p>

<p>We forgot all about the hike as we sat at supper
that evening. The only absentees were the two
little boys, Michel and Paul. And they were really
absent only from our board—they were in the room,
in the great built-in bed that was later to hold also
Madame and Solange. Their little bodies were covered
by the three-foot thick mattress-like red silk
quilt, but their tousled heads protruded and they
watched us unblinkingly all the evening.</p>

<p>But just as we sat down, before Sergeant Reilly
began his task of dishing out the potatoes and starting
the bottles on their way, Madame stopped her
chattering and looked at Solange. And Solange
stopped her chattering and looked at Madame.
And they both looked rather searchingly at us. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
didn’t know what was the matter, but we felt rather
embarrassed.</p>

<p>Then Madame began to talk, slowly and loudly,
as one talks to make foreigners understand. And
the gist of her remarks was that she was surprised
to see that American Catholics did not say grace
before eating like French Catholics.</p>

<p>We sprang to our feet at once. But it was not
Sergeant Reilly who saved the situation. Instead,
the ex-seminarian (he is only temporarily an
ex-seminarian, he’ll be preaching missions and giving
retreats yet if a bit of shrapnel doesn’t hasten his
journey to Heaven) said, after we had blessed ourselves:
“Benedicite: nos et quae sumus sumpturi
benedicat Deus, Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.
Amen.”</p>

<p>Madame and Solange, obviously relieved, joined
us in the Amen, and we sat down again to eat.</p>

<p>It was a memorable feast. There was not much
conversation—except on the part of Madame and
Solange—but there was plenty of good cheer. Also
there was enough cheese and bread and wine and
potatoes for all of us—half starved as we were when
we sat down. Even big Considine, who drains a can
of condensed milk at a gulp and has been known to
eat an apple pie without stopping to take breath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
was satisfied. There were toasts, also, all proposed
by Sergeant Reilly—toasts to Madame, and to the
children, and to France, and to the United States,
and to the Old Grey Mare (this last toast having an
esoteric significance apparent only to <i lang="la">illuminati</i> of
Sergeant Reilly’s circle).</p>

<p>The table cleared and the “agimus tibi gratias”
duly said, we sat before the fire, most of us on the
floor. We were warm and happy and full of
good food and good wine. I spied a slip of paper
on the floor by Solange’s foot and unashamedly
read it. It was an accounting for the evening’s
expenditures—totaling exactly ten francs and fifty
centimes.</p>

<p>Now when soldiers are unhappy—during a long,
hard hike, for instance—they sing to keep up their
spirits. And when they are happy, as on the evening
now under consideration, they sing to express
their satisfaction with life. We sang “Sweet Rosie
O’Grady.” We shook the kitchen-bedroom with
the echoes of “Take Me Back to New York Town.”
We informed Madame, Solange, Paul, Michel, in
fact, the whole village, that we had never been a
wanderer and that we longed for our Indiana home.
We grew sentimental over “Mother Machree.”
And Sergeant Reilly obliged with a reel—in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
socks—to an accompaniment of whistling and hand-clapping.</p>

<p>Now, it was our hostess’s turn to entertain. We
intimated as much. She responded, first by much
talk, much consultation with Solange, and finally by
going to one of the shelves that held the pans and
taking down some paper-covered books.</p>

<p>There was more consultation, whispered this
time, and much turning of pages. Then, after some
preliminary coughing and humming, the music began—the
woman’s rich alto blending with the child’s
shrill but sweet notes. And what they sang was
“Tantum ergo Sacramentum.”</p>

<p>Why she should have thought that an appropriate
song to offer this company of rough soldiers
from a distant land I do not know. And why we
found it appropriate it is harder still to say. But
it did seem appropriate to all of us—to Sergeant
Reilly, to Jim (who used to drive a truck), to Larry
(who sold cigars), to Frank (who tended a bar on
Fourteenth Street). It seemed, for some reason,
eminently fitting. Not one of us then or later expressed
any surprise that this hymn, familiar to
most of us since our mothers first led us to the Parish
Church down the pavements of New York or
across the Irish hills, should be sung to us in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
strange land and in these strange circumstances.</p>

<p>Since the gracious Latin of the Church was in
order and since the season was appropriate, one of
us suggested “Adeste Fideles” for the next item
on the evening’s program. Madame and Solange
and our ex-seminarian knew all the words and the
rest of us came in strong with “Venite, adoremus
Dominum.”</p>

<p>Then, as if to show that piety and mirth may live
together, the ladies obliged with “Au Clair de la
Lune” and other simple ballads of old France.
And after taps had sounded in the street outside our
door, and there was yawning, and wrist-watches
were being scanned, the evening’s entertainment
ended, by general consent, with patriotic selections.
We sang—as best we could—the <i>Star Spangled
Banner</i>, Solange and her mother humming the air
and applauding at the conclusion. Then we attempted
<i lang="fr">La Marseillaise</i>. Of course we did not
know the words. Solange came to our rescue with
two little pamphlets containing the song, so we
looked over each other’s shoulders and got to work
in earnest. Madame sang with us, and Solange.
But during the final stanza Madame did not sing.
She leaned against the great family bedstead and
looked at us. She had taken one of the babies from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
under the red comforter and held him to her breast.
One of her red and toil-scarred hands half covered
his fat little back. There was a gentle dignity about
that plain, hard-working woman, that soldier’s
widow—we all felt it. And some of us saw the tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>There are mists, faint and beautiful and unchanging,
that hang over the green slopes of some mountains
I know. I have seen them on the Irish hills
and I have seen them on the hills of France. I think
that they are made of the tears of good brave women.</p>

<p>Before I went to sleep that night I exchanged a
few words with Sergeant Reilly. We lay side by
side on the floor, now piled with straw. Blankets,
shelter-halves, slickers and overcoats insured warm
sleep. Sergeant Reilly’s hard old face was wrapped
round with his muffler. The final cigarette of the
day burned lazily in a corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>“That was a pretty good evening, Sarge,” I said.
“We sure were in luck when we struck this billet.”</p>

<p>He grunted affirmatively, then puffed in silence
for a few minutes. Then he deftly spat the cigarette
into a strawless portion of the floor, where it
glowed for a few seconds before it went out.</p>

<p>“You said it,” he remarked. “We were in luck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
is right. What do you know about that lady, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why,” I answered, “I thought she treated us
pretty white.”</p>

<p>“Joe,” said Sergeant Reilly, “do you realize how
much trouble that woman took to make this bunch
of roughnecks comfortable? She didn’t make a
damn cent on that feed, you know. The kid spent
all the money we give her. And she’s out about
six francs for firewood, too—I wish to God I had
the money to pay her. I bet she’ll go cold for a
week now, and hungry, too.</p>

<p>“And that ain’t all,” he continued, after a pause
broken only by an occasional snore from our blissful
neighbours. “Look at the way she cooked them
pomme de terres and fixed things up for us and let
us sit down there with her like we was her family.
And look at the way she and the little Sallie there
sung for us.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Joe, it makes me think of old times
to hear a woman sing them Church hymns to me
that way. It’s forty years since I heard a hymn
sung in a kitchen, and it was my mother, God rest
her, that sang them. I sort of realize what we’re
fighting for now, and I never did before. It’s for
women like that and their kids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>“It gave me a turn to see her a-sitting their singing
them hymns. I remembered when I was a boy
in Shangolden. I wonder if there’s many women
like that in France now—telling their beads and
singing the old hymns and treating poor traveling
men the way she’s just after treating us. There
used to be lots of women like that in the Old Country.
And I think that’s why it was called ‘Holy
Ireland.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_26">THE GENTLE ART OF CHRISTMAS GIVING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If a</span> dentist stuck a bit of holly in his cap and
went through the streets on Christmas morning,
his buzzing drill over his shoulder and his forceps in
his hand, stopping at the houses of his friends to give
their jaws free treatment, meanwhile trolling out
lusty Yuletide staves—if he were to do this, I say,
it would be said of him, among other things, that he
was celebrating Christmas in a highly original
manner. Undoubtedly there would be many other
adjectives applied to his manner of generosity—adjectives
applied, for instance, by the children whom,
around their gayly festooned tree, he surprised with
his gift of expert treatment. But the adjective
most generally used (not perhaps in adulation)
would be “original.” And the use of this adjective
would be utterly wrong.</p>

<p>The holly bedecked dentist would not be acting in
an original manner. He would not be following the
suggestion of his own philanthropic heart. He
would be acting in accordance with tradition, a particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
annoying tradition, the evil and absurd
superstition that a gift should be representative of
the giver rather than of the recipient.</p>

<p>Now, I am aware that there is high literary
authority for the dentist’s Christmas morning expedition.
The dentist himself would be the first to
disclaim having originated the idea; if you were to
question him he would tell you, as he deftly adjusted
his rubber dam in your mouth, that the credit
belonged to the late Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>

<p>“Emerson,” the dentist would say as he sharpened
the point of his drill, “said that a gift was
meaningless unless it was a genuine expression of
the giver; it would be unfitting, for instance, for a
poet to give his friend a house and lot, and a painter,
his friend, a diamond necklace. The poet should
give a poem and the painter should give a painting.
Therefore it naturally follows that a minister should
give a sermon and a school teacher should bestow
upon his expectant pupils an extra page of mathematical
problems. This,” the dentist would say,
“is the gift most expressive of my personality.”
And the drill would seek its goal.</p>

<p>Now, there is much to be said in favour of the
Emersonian theory of giving. Certainly it has the
advantages of cheapness and convenience. Many a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
poet could more easily give his friend a whole ode
or a sequence of sonnets or a bale of vers libre than
he could give a box of cigars, or a cigar. Many a
painter could more easily cover his children’s Christmas
tree with his own cubist canvases than with
peppermint canes and toy locomotives and dolls
and little trumpets. A storekeeper or a manufacturer
of any sort can more easily select his gifts
from his own stock than he can select them elsewhere.
Should a brewer, for instance, desire to help
make Mr. Bryan’s Christmas happy, it would be a
simpler matter for him to put in that gentleman’s
stocking a case of beer than a case of grape juice.</p>

<p>But cheapness and convenience are not the chief
reasons for this sort of giving. A poet who gives
a poem when he should give a pair of fur gauntlets,
a painter who gives a painting when he should give
a doll, does so, it often happens, in spite of the fact
that he has thousands of dollars in the bank and
lives within a block of a department store, which he
much enjoys visiting. He gives the gifts that he
does give because of his selfishness and conceit. He
gives his own wares because they advertise his
talent.</p>

<p>The poet knows that his friend will not say, to
inquiring admirers of his fur gauntlets, “These were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
given me by Ezra Dusenbury, author of ‘Babylonian
Bleatings’ and other Lyrics: Smith, Parker &amp;
Co., $1 net.” The painter knows that the infant
he has enriched will not say to her young companions:
“‘Bettina’ was given me by the illustrious Gaspar
Slifestein whose incomprehensiblist canvases
are now on exhibition at the Microscopic Mania
Gallery, 249 Fifth Avenue, New York City.”
These gentlemen take a violent interest in their own
work, and when they give presents of that work
they are trying to force their friends to share that
interest and to extend it to all the world. They are
trying to force their friends to become their press
agents.</p>

<p>Of course there are exceptions to the rule that a
giver should not give his own wares. Any man who
deals in wares that are universally delightful may
express himself in his gifts to his heart’s content and
no one will criticise him. So let no brewer or cigar-maker
or money-changer of my acquaintance puzzle
his head long in the effort to discover in the marts
of the world something appropriate to my peculiar
tastes. These honest citizens may be as Emersonian
in their giving as they wish.</p>

<p>As I said, there is much to recommend the idea
that inspired the hypothetical dentist on his Yuletide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
denting; there is much to recommend the gift-expressing-the-giver
theory. It is convenient, it is
cheap, it is satisfying to the giver’s conceit. It is
in many respects excellent. But it does not happen
to be suited to Christmas Day. It is suited to the
celebration of Emerson’s birthday, if any one knows
the date of that festival.</p>

<p>You see, unselfishness is supposed to be a characteristic
of Christmas giving. And unselfishness,
true unselfishness, was known to the philosophy of
the Transcendentalists as little as it is known to that
of the Nietzscheans. He who gives really in accordance
with the spirit of the feast gives not to express
his own personality, to call attention to his
own prowess as a painter or a poet or a candlestick-maker,
but to make his friend happy. If his friend
remembers him when he enjoys the gift, so much
the better. But the essential thing is that he shall
enjoy the gift.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell represented the Founder
of the Feast of Christmas as saying: “Who gives
himself in his gift feeds three; himself, his suffering
neighbour and me.” But in Lowell’s mind when he
wrote this was no idea of justifying the poet who
thrusts poems into his friends’ Christmas stocking
and tips the elevator man with a villanelle. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
thinking of sacrificial giving, of giving which necessitates
a sacrifice on the part of the giver rather than
on that of the recipient. And it is no sacrifice for a
poet to give his poem or his book of poems. James
Russell Lowell’s distinguished kinswoman, now living
in Boston, knows this. If Miss Amy Lowell
really loves you she will give you for Christmas an
automobile or one of her Keats manuscripts, rather
than an autographed copy of “Sword Blades and
Poppy Seeds,” or “Men, Women, and Ghosts.”</p>

<p>Few Bishops resemble Mark Twain. But there
once was a Bishop who resembled Mark Twain in
this respect (and in no other)—he is known to many
thousands who do not know his real name. Mark
Twain has thousands of friends who never heard of
Samuel Langhorne Clemens. And hundreds of
thousands of children yearly are gladdened by
Santa Claus, yet have no association whatever with
the name of Saint Nicholas of Bari.</p>

<p>Yet the amiable Nicholas (who is the patron of
sailors, of prisoners, and of children) is the benefactor
of humanity caricatured during December
in every shop window and on every eleemosynary
corner. His mitre has degenerated into a hat
trimmed with doubtful fur; his embroidered cope
has become a red jacket. But (except when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
rings a little bell and begs for alms) he has retained
his extra-episcopal function of giving. Saint
Nicholas was a master of the art of giving; and since
we have taken him so seriously as to transmogrify
him into Santa Claus, we should profit by his illustrious
example and model our giving upon his.</p>

<p>How and what did Saint Nicholas give? Well,
he gave tactfully and opportunely and appropriately.
There was the nobleman of Lucia whose
three daughters were starving to death. Saint
Nicholas gave them marriage portions, throwing
purses of gold in at the window at night. When
he was in Myra he gave to the poor people all the
wheat that was in the ships in the harbour, promising
the owners that when they arrived at the port
for which they were bound their ships would still be
full of wheat; and so it came about. To a drowned
sailor and to children who had been killed by a
cannibal he gave the gift of life. And to innocent
men accused of treason and imprisoned he gave
freedom.</p>

<p>His first gift, you see, was money, his second life,
his third freedom. And thus he set an example to
all the world. Now, it may not be convenient for
us to celebrate Christmas by throwing money
through the windows of apartments wherein repose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
dowerless young women. Nor are life and freedom
gifts for our bestowal. But it is at any rate possible
for us to imitate Saint Nicholas’s manner of
giving; to give tactfully, opportunely, and appropriately.
There was nothing especially characteristic
of his episcopal functions in the gifts that Saint
Nicholas gave. Nor did he worry about whether or
not they reflected his personality. Let us make
Santa Claus resemble Saint Nicholas as closely as
we can.</p>

<p>This business of expressing one’s personality by
one’s gifts has been carried to extraordinary lengths
of late years. There are people who actually select
for all their friends and relatives things that they
themselves would like. If they consider themselves
to be dainty—as all women do—they give dainty
presents, disregarding the fact that the recipient
may suffer acute physical pain at the mere thought
of daintiness.</p>

<p>They wish their beneficiaries to say on Christmas
morning, “How characteristic of Mrs. Slipslop to
give me this exquisite Dresden china chewing-gum
holder,” instead of “How generous and discerning
of Mrs. Slipslop to give me this pair of rubber boots
or this jar of tobacco or this hypodermic syringe!”
But what every child and every grown person wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
to receive is a gift suited to his tastes and habits; it
is a matter of indifference whether or not it expresses
the personality of the giver. Perhaps it will
in his eyes supply the giver with a new and charming
personality.</p>

<p>You have hitherto regarded Mr. Blinker, the
notorious efficiency engineer, with disfavour. You
have regarded him as a prosaic theorist, a curdled
mass of statistics. On Christmas morning you find
that he has presented you, not with an illuminated
copy of “Rules for Eliminating Leisure,” or a set
of household ledgers or an alarm clock, but with a
cocktail set or a pool table or an angora kitten or
some other inefficient object.</p>

<p>At once your opinion of Mr. Blinker changes for
the better. He assumes a new and radiant personality.
Your Sunday school teacher has always exhibited
to you virtues which you respect but do not
enjoy; she has seemed to you lacking in magnetism.
If she gives you for Christmas a Bible or a tale of
juvenile virtue, you will write her a graceful letter
of thanks (at your mother’s dictation), but your
affection for the estimable lady will not be materially
increased. But if your Sunday school teacher
gives you a bowie knife or a revolver or a set of the
Deadwood Dick novels! then how suddenly will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the nobility of your Sunday school teacher’s nature
be revealed to you!</p>

<p>To elevator men, janitors, domestic servants,
newspaper deliverers, and other necessary evils we
always give something appropriate—money. And
money does not express the personalities of most
of us. We—that is, the general public, the common
people, the populace, the average man, the great
washed and the rest of us—do our duty in this
matter, following religiously the admirable tradition
of the Christmas box. But our retainers—if
they will permit us thus picturesquely to address
them—do not. They serve us during the year, and
are duly paid for it, but they do nothing picturesque
and extraordinary at Christmas time to justify our
gifts to them.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they are not upholding their
part of the tradition. It is not enough for them to
bow, and say, “Thank you,” while they feverishly
count the money. They should revel romantically,
as did their predecessors who established the custom
by which they profit. The elevator boys should
sing West Indian carols under our windows—especially
if our apartment is in the twentieth story.
The janitor and his family should enact in the basement
a Christmas miracle play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>It is pleasant to think of the janitor attired as a
shepherd or as a Wise Man, with his children as
angels or as sheep, to picture the Yule log on the
janitorial hearth, and to hear in fancy, rising up the
dumbwaiter shaft, the strains of “The Carnal and
the Crane,” or of the excellent carol which begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The shepherd upon a hill he sat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had on him his tabard and his hat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His tarbox, his pipe and his flagat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His name was called Joly Joly Wat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he was a gud herdes boy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Ut hoy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For in his pipe he made so much joy!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In some places the newspaper deliverers and the
telegraph boys feebly support this tradition by writing,
or causing to be written, a “carrier’s address”
and leaving printed copies of it with their customers.
It would be better, of course, if they were to
sing or to recite these verses, but even the printed
address is better than nothing. It is a pity to see
even this slight concession to tradition disappearing.
In bygone days some of the most distinguished
of our poets were glad to write these addresses—the
late Richard Watson Gilder wrote one
for the newspaper carriers of Newark.</p>

<p>And then there are the numerous public servants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
who nowadays receive from the public no special
Christmas benefaction—How gracefully they
might obtain it by infusing into their occupations a
little Yuletide pageantry! As it is, the subway
guards celebrate the golden springtime by donning
white raiment. Let them on Christmas day be
wreathed with mingled holly and mistletoe, and let
them chant, in lusty chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">God rest you, merry gentlemen!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let nothing you dismay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Please slip us some coin, you’ve got money to boin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this is Christmas day.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Few subterranean voyagers could resist this appeal.</p>

<p>And the street cleaners, how comes it that they
are unrewarded of the public? Their predecessors,
the crossing sweepers of London fifty years ago,
exacted tribute from pedestrians not only at Christmas
time, but on every day of the year. Let our
street cleaners assume holiday garb and manner,
let them expect Christmas gifts, but give in turn a
Christmas spectacle. Methods of doing this will
readily suggest themselves—an appropriate thing
would be for them to procure mediæval attire at any
theatrical costumer’s, and build great bonfires at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
such points of vantage as Columbus Circle, Times
Square, Madison Square, and Union Square. Over
these bonfires boars’ heads should be roasted and
great bowls of steaming punch should hang. From
passersby who partook of their hospitality the street
cleaners, through one of their number dressed as an
almoner, should request a golden remembrance.
These things may yet come to pass. They are not
so archaic as seemed in nineteen-thirteen a worldwide
war. And the municipal Christmas trees are
a good beginning.</p>

<p>But to return to our muttons, or, rather, to our
geese and plum puddings, the most important thing
for us to remember in the selection of Christmas
presents is their suitability to the person for whom
they are intended. We may like books, but let us
not therefore feel obliged to sustain our literary
reputation by giving books to our neighbour who
wants a box of cigars or a jumping-jack. We have
the precedent, furnished by Saint Nicholas, and we
have a higher precedent still. For the first great
Christmas gift to humanity was what humanity
most needed, and always needs—a child.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_39">A BOUQUET FOR JENNY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">So far</span> as I know, in no other library but
mine is to be found a book illustrated by Jenny
Hand. Therefore, more than much vellum and
crushed levant, more than first editions and association
copies bearing famous signatures, do I prize
a certain fat volume, a foxed and dog-eared and
battered volume, which was published by Grigg and
Elliot (God rest them!) in Philadelphia at number
nine North Fourth Street in 1847. This is a book
of poetry, but it is no slender little pamphlet of a
thing, the shelter of one bardling’s lyrical ejaculations.
Five full-grown poets, two of them men of
noble girth, comfortably share this stately tenement.
The book’s solid and imposing name is “The
Poetical Works of Rogers, Campbell, J. Montgomery,
Lamb and Kirk White.”</p>

<p>A detailed consideration of this volume might, to
the profit of the reading public, fill all of one issue
of any book-review supplement or literary, so to
speak, section printed in America. But for the
moment I would write, not of the excellencies of
the volume in general, but of the distinguishing feature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
of my copy—its unique virtue, which gives me
the right to pity all other bibliophiles now rejoicing
in this illustrious Grigg and Elliot imprint. I refer
to the illustrations by Jenny Hand.</p>

<p>Messrs. Grigg and Elliot illustrated, to the best
of their ability, every copy of this work. They
illustrated it with what they doubtless termed “elegant
steel engravings.” These steel engravings are
indeed “elegant,” also they are “appropriate,” also
they are “chaste.” Take down from its shelf your
copy of “The Poetical Works of, etc.,” and you will
find, facing page ninety-four, a representation of
“Morning among the Alps,” painted, the legend
tells you, by T. Doughty, and engraved by George
W. Hatch. The sun is rising, much as Mr. Belasco
might direct, and upon a pleasant little pond in the
foreground are three of those famous Alpine early
birds known as swan. This picture is designed to
accompany Samuel Rogers’ “The Alps at Daybreak,”
lines which I may recall to your memory
by saying that they begin, “The sunbeams streak
the azure skies.” The picture was not intended by
the artists to be Alpine in character, but it is a nice
picture, very harmonious with the text.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the generous Messrs. Grigg and
Elliot, being greatly moved by those lines of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
ingenious Kirke White which begin: “Behold the
shepherd boy, who homeward tends, Finish’d his
daily labour.—O’er his path, Deep overhung with
herbage, does he stroll With pace irregular; by fits
he runs, Then sudden stops with vacant countenance,
And picks the pungent herb”—being greatly
moved, I say, by these lines, they determined to give
them a supplementary embellishment. Therefore
they caused one O. Pelton to engrave on steel a picture
first “Drawn by Cristall” (as who should say
“Painted by Raphael”). This shows us a plump
youth, with the vacant countenance celebrated by
the poet, standing upon the side of Vesuvius, carrying
over his shoulder a large spade, and in his left
hand a basket of potatoes. In their sensational
journalistic way, Messrs. Grigg and Elliot affixed
to this picture the caption, “The Shepherd Boy,”
and forthwith the poem was illustrated.</p>

<p>But while you will take pleasure, if you are a
worthy possessor of this volume, in these altogether
admirable engravings, you will look through your
copy in vain for expressions of the genius of Jenny
Hand. The Jenny Hand illustrations are two in
number, and they are to be found only in my copy.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of illustrating a book with
steel engravings is that it necessitates the inclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
of blank pages. When a steel engraving occupies
one side of a page, there may be nothing whatever
printed on the reverse.</p>

<p>There may be nothing printed, I said, on the reverse.
But on the reverse anything in the world
may be drawn or written. Therein we see the origin
of the entertaining practice of extra-illustration.
To the eager pencil of Jenny Hand, these virginal
white pages, oases among pages of dry verse,
offered irresistible opportunities. And my library
is therefore the richer.</p>

<p>This book never belonged to Jenny Hand, except
so far as anything belongs to one who makes it more
beautiful and interesting and useful. The book
belonged to Jenny’s sister, Esther. On the fly-leaf
is written “Mifs E.&nbsp;C. Hand, with regards of
C.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Q.” Obviously E.&nbsp;C. stands for Esther Conway.
Obviously, also, Esther did not herself draw
pictures on the beautiful volume of poesy (with
gold scroll work all over the cover) which the amorous
and tasteful Mr. C.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Q. presented to her.
This delightful work was done by Esther’s younger
sister, who in 1847 was aged perhaps thirteen, and
should have been and probably was named Jenny.
C.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Q. stands for Charles Francis Quigley. This
is not a random guess; it is a wholly logical deduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
from the portrait of the gentleman drawn by
Jenny, who knew him well.</p>

<p>It was one summer afternoon in 1847 that Jenny
first began to improve “The Poetical Works of
Rogers, Campbell, J. Montgomery, Lamb and
Kirke White.” At three o’clock Jenny had been
out playing—keeping the porch and the front gate
well in sight, for she knew that not for nothing had
Esther put on her pearl necklace and her blue sash
and spent three-quarters of an hour over her hair.
Jenny’s suspicions were justified and her vigilance
rewarded. At four o’clock the front gate clicked
and the gravel walk resounded under a manly tread.
Charlie Quigley, in a high stock, a flowered waistcoat,
a long black coat, tight blue trousers and a
tall silk hat, came to call on Esther. And he
brought a gift. Was it a box of candy? If so
Jenny would, as a dutiful sister, help to entertain
the company. She would wait—Esther was unwrapping
the present. No, it was not a box of
candy—it was a book. And it was not even a novel,
it was a book of poetry, of all things in the world!
How could that Charlie Quigley be so silly?</p>

<p>Well, Jenny lost interest in Charlie and his gift
for a while. She rolled her hoop and played with
the puppy while Esther and Charlie sat on the porch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
and looked at the foolish book. When Jenny came
up on the porch, toward sunset, they had gone into
the parlour. They had left the book open face
downward on a bench, open to Thomas Campbell’s
“Song,” beginning “Oh, how hard it is to find The
one just suited to our mind”—certain lines of which
Charlie had roguishly underscored.</p>

<p>Jenny turned the pages of the book, but found
therein little entertainment. At length, however,
she came upon “Morning in the Alps,” with its
blank and inviting reverse. Among the jackstones
in her pocket was the stub of a pencil, and soon that
pencil was at its predestined task of depicting the
event of the afternoon—for my edification some
threescore years later.</p>

<p>Jenny drew a side view of the broad stone steps,
with a little of the railings and Grecian pillars. She
drew the locust tree, and since she knew that there
was a robin’s nest in it, she outlined two little birds
against the skyey background. She drew Esther,
grand in her hoopskirts, necklace, curls and blue
sash—no, it wasn’t blue, it was green plaid, and the
fabric was satin, for, as I live, there is a faded corner
of it in this very book, sentimentally cut off and
placed there by Esther herself! Why was Esther
so particular about saving a fragment of that sash?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Was this really a momentous afternoon? Was this
the sash that Charlie’s black broadcloth sleeve surrounded
when Esther consented to become Mrs.
Quigley? And were they married, and did
Charlie’s friends all make flat jokes about his claiming
the hand of Hand?</p>

<p>And were all these things going on while the
artistic Jenny was busy on the porch? Possibly.
Probably. But with such conjectures the author of
this serious essay in art criticism has no concern.
To return to the account of the picture—Jenny
drew next the renowned Charles Francis Quigley.
But now her pencil was dipped in a mild solution of
venom—imparted to it, I fear, when she thoughtfully
placed its point between her small lips. For
those same lips had desired chocolates—and the
chocolates had turned out to be nothing but poesy.
Therefore she sacrificed realism to satire, and made
Charlie (really a very nice fellow, whom she came
to like very much in later years) something of a
fop. She made the cut of his coat too extreme, his
hair too curly, his mustache too obviously waxed.
She deliberately gave his eye a sentimental expression;
she smiled derisively as she padded his pictured
sleeve.</p>

<p>And then she gave her drawing its crowning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
charm—she put in the “selbst-portrait.” She drew
the little cedar tree that flanked the porch, and she
drew herself kneeling beside it—seeing, but not seen
by, the rapt Esther and Charlie. Far from being
ashamed of this act of sisterly espionage, she gloried
in it, and brought all her art to the task of immortalising
it.</p>

<p>So in my book the locust tree is forever in leaf
and two little birds poise always against the summer
sky. And always Charlie, hat in hand, presents to
the radiant Esther “The Poetical Works of Rogers,
Campbell, J. Montgomery, Lamb and Kirke
White.” And always the little artist, with long
curls hanging over her white frock, laughs at the
lovers from behind her cedar tree.</p>

<p>The light was fading now, but Jenny had found
another blank page—that preceding the section devoted
to Kirke White’s verses. Supper wouldn’t
be ready for fifteen minutes, so she started on a picture
more difficult than the simple incident just
drawn. She chose for her scene Riley’s Riding
Academy, where she and Esther spent every Wednesday
morning. There was Esther, seated with
the sedateness appropriate to her eighteen years,
upon the tamest of nags. And there was Jenny, in
her fetching habit, perilously poised upon her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
wildly careering steed. With enthusiastic pencil
did Jenny depict her own brave unconcern, and
Esther’s timorousness. How firmly Esther
clutches the reins of her mild beast, how startled is
her face as she looks upon her daring and nonchalant
younger sister!</p>

<p>Did the Quigleys and the Hands, I wonder, shed
tears over Mr. Southey’s “Account of the Life of
Henry Kirke White”? Did they know Francis
Boott, of Boston, the young American gentleman
who placed, Mr. Southey tells us, a tablet to
Henry’s memory in All Saints Church, Cambridge?
Were they moved by James Montgomery’s “Prison
Amusements; Written during nine months confinement
in the Castle of York, in the years of 1795 and
1796”? Mr. Montgomery tells us in the prefatory
advertisement, “they were the transcripts of melancholy
feelings—the warm effusions of a bleeding
heart.” Did they read “Gertrude of Wyoming,”
“Theodric; a Domestic Tale,” and the
“Pleasures of Hope”?</p>

<p>Did they read the memoirs prefaced to the various
selections? If so, I hope they found them as
delightful as I do. There is the inexhaustibly fascinating
“Memoirs of Charles Lamb,” in which the
anonymous critic improves the occasion by reproving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
sternly the Lake Poets, or the “Lakers,” as he
calls them. “The thousand Songs,” he tells us, “of our
writers in verse of past time dwell on all tongues,
with the melodies of Moore. But who learns or repeats
the cumbrous verses of Wordsworth, which
require an initiation from their writer to comprehend?”
Later this gentleman has occasion to refer
to “Another School of Poetry,” which “arose in opposition
to that of the Lakers.” “Their talents,” he
writes, “are before the world. To this new school
belonged the late poet Shelley, whose lofty powers
are unquestionable; Keats, also now deceased; and
Leigh Hunt.” Keats, also now deceased! What
porridge fed the writer of this memoir?</p>

<p>Well, my concern is not with the poor hack who
edited this book and wrote the memoirs. I hope
Messrs. Grigg and Elliot paid him well. And as
for Charlie and Esther and Jenny and the robins in
the locust tree—well, Charlie Quigley’s dust and his
good sword’s rust, and his soul is with the saints, I
trust. I hope Esther married him. I’m glad he
brought her “The Poetical Works of Rogers,
Campbell, J. Montgomery, Lamb and Kirke
White,” even if Jenny was disappointed. For if
she’d made her drawings on the cover of a candy
box they would not now be in my library.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_49">THE INEFFICIENT LIBRARY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There are</span> young gentlemen whose delight
it is to tell their married and established and
venerable friends how to form libraries. Generally,
these young gentlemen wear spectacles rimmed
with tortoise shell, and the condensed milk of their
alma mater is yet wet upon their lips. They peer
at your laden shelves and say: “It is better to have
one good book than a dozen bad ones. Of any
standard work you should have the definitive edition—not
necessarily a rare imprint or something in fine
binding, but the most modern and comprehensive
edition. It is better to have one good anthology
than a shelfful of third-rate poets. Go through your
shelves and throw away all the rubbish; buy sets of
the classics, a volume at a time, and in this way you
will gradually build up a useful and really representative
library, something appropriate and coherent.”</p>

<p>When a young gentleman talks to you in this
wise, the only thing to do is to lead him gently away
from the bookshelves and make him sit in a comfortable
corner and talk to you about hockey or socialism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
or some other of his boyish sports. He
knows absolutely nothing about libraries. Probably
he lives in the shadow of Washington Arch, and his
own library—on the bureau—consists of the “Life
of General Ulysses S. Grant,” inscribed “To dearest
Teddy, from Aunt Mag., Xmas, 1916,” and a
copy of the New Republic for last August, containing
a letter in which he took exception to an editorial
on the relation between pragmatism and Freud’s
second theory of the semi-subconscious. To-morrow
he will sell General Grant to a second-hand
book dealer for fifteen cents, and thereby diminish
his library by one half. What right has he to tell
you what books you shall keep and what you shall
destroy?</p>

<p>Now, it would not be so bad if this raving about
a library was confined to young persons like him
I have mentioned. But the trouble is, there are
people of means and reputation for intelligence who
are actually putting into practice the evil theories
he advances, who are deliberately “building up
libraries,” instead of surrounding themselves with
books they like. Against this pernicious heresy it is
the duty of every honest bibliophile to protest.</p>

<p>We need waste no words on the purchaser of
“subscription sets” and many-volumed collections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of “Kings and Queens of Neo-Cymric Realism and
Romance,” and “The Universalest of All Libraries
of Super-extraordinary Fiction,” in forty-eight
volumes, fifteen dollars down and five dollars a
month until the purchaser is summoned to a Better
Land. Either these people want books for mere
shelf-furniture, or else they are the victims of voracious
book agents, and deserve a tear of sympathy
rather than a rebuke. Our concern, the concern of
those who have at heart the good name of printed
literature and the liberty of the individual householder
of literary tastes, is with the person who is
highly literate and possessed of an account with a
bookseller, and is abusing his talent and privilege
by “efficiently” building up a library.</p>

<p>When efficiency confined itself to the office and
the factory, it was bad enough. When it (loathsome
animal that it is!) crawled up a leg of the
table and began to preach to us about our food, babbling
obscenely of proteids and carbohydrates, we
felt that the limit of endurance had been reached.
But no sooner do we cuff efficiency from the dining
table than it pops up in the library. And this is not
to be endured. Efficiency must be plucked down,
kindly, of course, but resolutely, from the bookshelves,
and put in a covered basket to await the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
coming of the wagon which shall convey it to the
lethal of the S.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.</p>

<p>Except for an efficient family, what could be less
interesting than an efficient library? Think of the
sameness of it—every study in a block of houses
containing the “Oxford Dictionary” and “Roget’s
Thesaurus” and the “Collected Essays of Hamilton
Wright Mabie” and similar works of reference,
with a few standard fictions such as Arnold Bennett’s
“Your United States,” and Owen Wister’s
“The Pentecost of Calamity”! There would be no
adventures among books possible in such libraries.
Indeed, efficiency in the library would soon reduce
it, if logically developed, to a collection of anthologies
and reference books, and possibly some such
practical jokes as ex-President Eliot’s “Five Foot
Shelf.”</p>

<p>An advocate of the efficient library, a spectacled
young gentleman of the type already described,
once engaged in some ignoble literary task—book-reviewing
I believe it was called—while a guest at
my house. The volume of which he was writing a
criticism had to do with a single-tax experiment in
New Zealand, and therefore he wished to include in
his review a quotation from the “Life of Benvenuto
Cellini.” He did not find the “Life of Benvenuto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Cellini” on my shelves, and therefore reproached
me, and made my library the object of his callow
disapproval.</p>

<p>I reasoned with him. He had read Benvenuto, I
said, and Benvenuto was waiting for him in the
public library if he desired to renew his acquaintance
with him. Here, I said, are many volumes of
biography and autobiography in place of the one
for which you cry. Here is a book entitled “The
Life and Labours of Henry W. Grady, his
Speeches, Writings, etc., Being in Addition to a
Graphic Sketch of His Life, a Collection of His
Most Remarkable Speeches and Such of His Writings
as Best Illustrate His Character and Show the
Wonderful Brilliancy of His Intellect, also Such
Letters, Speeches, and Newspaper Articles in connection
with His Life and Death as Will Be of
General Interest.” Here, I said, is “Colonel
Thomas Blood, Crown Stealer,” by Wilbur Cortez
Abbott, a highly entertaining book. Here, I continued,
as a preface to this collection of the “Essays
in Prose and Verse of J. Clarence Mangan,” is an
illuminating biographical essay by Mr. C.&nbsp;P. Meehan,
together with Mr. J. Wilson’s “Phrenological
Description of Mangan’s Head,” and “The Poet’s
Own Recipe to Make Tar Water.” Here <span class="locked">is—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>But my friend rudely interrupted my well-meant
remarks, and went in quest of Cellini to the south-west
corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-second
Street, where he found a library more suited to his
efficient tastes. In doing this he was perfectly justified.
Public Libraries should be efficient. They
are places to which you go to get useful but uninteresting
information. But there is no more reason for
your own library to resemble a public library than
there is for your study to resemble your office, or for
your dining-room to resemble the Automat, or for
every bedroom in your house to bear on its door
printed directions to ring twice for your wife to
bring you hot water and three times for a clean
collar.</p>

<p>The crowning virtue of the successful private library
is inefficiency. As an example closely approaching
the ideal, as a model to householders who
have been allowed a closet or vault in which to keep
books, I respectfully present my own library. And
in order that the radiance of its inefficiency may be
as penetrating as possible, I wish my library to be
considered in comparison with its efficient rivals.</p>

<p>Let us therefore assume that the spectacled young
gentleman already several times celebrated in this
treatise has, without acquiring more sense, got married,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and perhaps thereby acquired a sufficient competency
to warrant his establishing a library. Let us
begin our survey of his books with the shelves of
poetry. Where is there a good basis for comparison?
Ah, here we have it—here is Milton in the
efficient library, and here the long-winded old
gentleman is found again in my own! Is any comparison
between these volumes possible? Would
any real bibliophile hesitate a moment in making his
choice between the two? The efficient Milton is a
tall, sombre-looking volume with a long biographical
preface by a man who used to be a poet before
he became a college professor, a preface which
proves that Milton never went blind, lived in Wales
rather than in England, had only one daughter and
knew no Latin. At the foot of every page there is a
thick sprinkling of notes conveying unnecessary
information. There is an appendix of variant readings
and an exhaustive, monumental bibliography.</p>

<p>Could anything be more depressing? The only
illustration in the book is John himself, in a black
cloak, with what seems to be a baby’s bib under his
chin, and this picture can scarcely be called a decoration.
My “Milton’s Poetical Works,” which was
published in New York in 1857 and purchased by
me from a stall on Twenty-third Street for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
quarter, is more entertaining in every respect. In
the first place, it has no notes—which alone makes it
worth the price of admission. In the second place,
the only biographical introduction is “The Life of
Milton, by His Nephew, Edward Philips,” a most
estimable piece of writing, which begins, “Of all
the several parts of history, that which sets forth
the lives, and commemorates the most remarkable
actions, sayings or writings of famous and illustrious
persons, whether in war or peace—whether
many together, or any one in particular—as it is not
the least useful in itself, so it is in the highest vogue
and esteem among the studious and reading part of
mankind.” Doesn’t a biography of this sort
promise more flavours and exciting things than one
written by a college professor, and beginning,
“John Milton was born in London, England, December
9th, 1608”?</p>

<p>Furthermore, my Milton is bound in black cloth,
with stars and wreaths and baskets of flowers
stamped in gold all over it. Furthermore, my
Milton has all sorts of highly entertaining steel engravings,
most delightfully 1857—Lycidas being
shipwrecked on St. Michael’s Mount, and the Warring
Angels mustering for battle, and skeletons and
devils and angels and “wood nymphs, deck’d with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
daisies trim,” keeping “their merry wakes and pastimes,”
and Melancholy, who looks like Queen Victoria
in her old age, and the “Goddess fair and free,
in heaven yclep’d Euphrosyne,” wearing a very becoming
white frock. Furthermore, my Milton was
“Presented to Mifs Ellen R. Baxter, by Her Resp’t’l
friend, J. Stuart, Oswego, May 4, 1859”—so
the violet ink inscription on the flyleaf tells me.
And some one has drawn in pencil a very attractive
cat on the blank page opposite the opening of
“Samson Agonistes.” The efficient library’s copy
of Milton lacks all these amiable associations.</p>

<p>My efficient friend possesses a Byron, it is true.
But not to be mentioned in the same breath with the
volume which stands in my study between Witter
Bynner and Bliss Carman. My Byron contains
eight contemporary memoirs of the poet, by distinguished
fellow-craftsmen, and sixteen pictures—himself,
his birthplace, his Newfoundland dog, his
daughter, and a dozen landscapes which the publisher
happened to have on hand. Also, in the
preface of my Byron I find this sentence: “Thus
died Lord Byron at the early age of thirty-seven,
leaving behind him a name second only to that of
the renowned Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, and
a memory which the sublime effusions of his muse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
will endear to all posterity.” My friend’s Byron
has nothing to compare with this.</p>

<p>The trouble with my friend’s library is that it has
no surprises. Any one who has seen his waistcoat—the
V of which is edged with heavy white cord—and
his cuff links—which are oval and bear, engraven on
their golden surfaces, his initials—could describe
his library to a volume. It is obvious; its obviousness
is a part of its efficiency.</p>

<p>I suppose Benvenuto Cellini is on a shelf of the
efficient library. He must be, since he is in the public
library. Probably my efficient friend has also
Benjamin Franklin’s “Autobiography” and the
“Complete Works of Mrs. Humphry Ward.” He
has a limp-leather tissue-paper encyclopedia, and an
obese dictionary, and a magnificent atlas. And in a
corner of his study he has a map of the world in the
form of a great globe on a pivot.</p>

<p>I envy him this last possession, for one may
amuse himself by spinning a geographical globe, as
one entertains himself by spinning a piano stool.
But aside from this, there is nothing in my friend’s
library that I desire. And my own triumphantly
inefficient library—what treasures it contains!</p>

<p>You mention French literature. Do I overwhelm
you with a sumptuous Voltaire, or sicken you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
with a sentimentally illustrated “Paul et Virginie”?
I do not. I exhibit to you yellow-back volumes of
the later verse of Francis Jammes—which are supposed
to be going to be bound one of these days—or
I show you a play or two of Rostand’s. If you desire
to have further dealings with the literature of
France, the French department of the university is,
for a consideration, at your service. You mention
Fraser’s “Golden Bough”? I show you something
equally informing and more entertaining, comfortable
volumes in which the mythology of Ireland is
narrated to us by Jeremiah Curtin and by Seumas
MacManus, and I show you a stray volume of
Louis Ginzberg’s “The Legends of the Jews.”</p>

<p>I should not try to make the possessors of efficient
libraries unhappy. But I do it for their own good,
in the hope that I may eventually reform them.
And when I look upon my two volumes of “The
Evergreen,” a quarterly published in Edinburgh
some twenty years ago, numbering among its contributors
Fiona MacLeod, Nora Hopper, Douglas
Hyde, Standish O’Grady and Rosa Mulholland,
and “The Squire’s Recipes,” by Kendall Banning,
and “Scottish Heraldry Made Easy,” and Shaemas
O’Sheel’s “The Dear Old Lady of Eighty-sixth
Street,” and a bound volume of The Gentleman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Magazine for 1761 and “L. Annsei Senecae et
Aliorum Tragoediae (Amsterodami, Apud Guiljel:
Ians: Caesium)” and a battered edition of
Scott’s “Marmion,” enriched by the comments of
a Louise Cogswell who owned it in 1810 and wrote
approvingly, “and very well told too” under the
sub-title “A Tale of Flodden Field,” and Joseph
Forster’s “Studies in Black and Red” (very ghastly),
and both of Ernest Dowson’s novels and his
translations from the French, as well as his poems,
and “The American Annual of Photography” for
1916, and “Miss Thackeray’s Works,” complete in
one volume, and Layton Crippen’s “Clay and
Fire,” and Bithell’s “Contemporary Belgian Poetry,”
and Sir Francis Burnand’s “More Happy
Thoughts,” and a volume containing “The Poetical
Works of Rogers, Campbell, J. Montgomery
Lamb, and Kirke White,” and an inscribed copy of
Palmer Cox’s “The Brownies, Their Book”—when
I contemplate, among the more commonplace inhabitants
of my shelves, these books, then I cannot
keep from feeling a sense of superiority to all those
who have laboriously “built up” their libraries in accordance
with the mandates of strict utility.</p>

<p>My library is inefficient and impractical, entertaining
and unexacting. Its members have come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
me by chance and by momentary inclination. For
if a man’s books are to be, as the old phrase has it,
his friends, they must be allowed to him because of
some fitness on his part subtly felt by them. A man
does not deliberately select his friends; there must
be a selection by them as well as by him. Unless he
is applying the principles of efficiency to friendship.
And in that case he has no friends at all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_62">THE POETRY OF HILAIRE BELLOC</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Far from</span> the poets being astray in prose-writing
(said Francis Thompson), it might
plausibly be contended that English prose, as an
art, is but a secondary stream of the Pierian fount,
and owes its very origin to the poets. The first
writer one remembers with whom prose became an
art was Sir Philip Sidney. And Sidney was a poet.</p>

<p>This quotation is relevant to a consideration of
Hilaire Belloc, because Belloc is a poet who happens
to be known chiefly for his prose. His <cite>Danton</cite>
and <cite>Robespierre</cite> have been read by every intelligent
student of French history, his <cite>Path to Rome</cite>, that
most high-spirited and engaging of travel books,
has passed through many editions, his political writings
are known to all lovers—and many foes—of
democracy, his whimsically imaginative novels have
their large and appreciative audience, and his exquisite
brief essays are contemporary classics. And
since the unforgetable month of August of the unforgetable
year 1914, Hilaire Belloc has added to
the number of his friends many thousands who care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
little for <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i> and less for the French Revolution—he
has become certainly the most popular,
and by general opinion the shrewdest and best informed,
of all chroniclers and critics of the Great
War.</p>

<p>There is nothing, it may be said, about these
achievements to indicate the poet. How can this
most public of publicists woo the shy and exacting
Muse? His superabundant energy may now and
again overflow in little lyrical rivulets, but how can
he find time to turn it into the deep channels of
song?</p>

<p>Well, what is the difference between a poet who
writes prose and a prose-writer who writes verse?
The difference is easy to see but hard to describe.
Mr. Thomas Hardy is a prose writer. He has forsaken
the novel, of which he was so distinguished a
master, to make cynical little sonnet portraits and
to pour the acid wine of his philosophy—a sort of
perverted Presbyterianism—into the graceful
amphora of poetic drama. But he is not a poet.
Thackeray was a prose-writer, in spite of his delicious
light verse. Every novelist writes or has
written verse, but not all of them are poets.</p>

<p>Of course, Sir Walter Scott was first of all a
poet—the greatest poet who ever wrote a novel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
And no one who has read <cite>Love in the Valley</cite> can
hesitate to give Meredith his proper title. Was
Macaulay a poet? I think so—but perhaps I am in
a hopeless minority in my belief that the author of
<cite>The Battle of Naseby</cite> and <cite>The Lays of Ancient
Rome</cite> was the last of the great English ballad makers.</p>

<p>But this general truth cannot, I think, honestly
be denied; there have been many great poets who
have devoted most of their lives to writing prose.
Some of them have died without discovering their
neglected talent. I think that Walter Pater was
one of these; much that is annoyingly subtle or annoyingly
elaborate in his essays needs only rhyme
and rhythm—the lovely accidents of poetry—to become
graceful and appropriate. His famous description
of the Mona Lisa is worthless if considered
as a piece of serious æsthetic criticism. But it would
make an admirable sonnet. And it is significant
that Walter Pater’s two greatest pupils—Lionel
Johnson and Father Gerard Hopkins, S.J.,—found
expression for their genius not in prose, the
chosen medium of their “unforgetably most gracious
friend,” but in verse.</p>

<p>From Walter Pater, that exquisite of letters, to
the robust Hilaire Belloc may seem a long journey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
But there is, I insist, this similarity between
these contrasting writers, both are poets, and both
are known to fame by their prose.</p>

<p>For proof that Walter Pater was a poet, it is
necessary only to read his <cite>Renaissance Studies</cite> or
his interpretations—unsound but fascinating—of
the soul of ancient Greece. Often his essays, too
delicately accurate in phrasing or too heavily laden
with golden rhetoric, seem almost to cry aloud for
the relief of rhyme and rhythm.</p>

<p>Now, Hilaire Belloc suggests in many of his
prose sketches that he is not using his true medium.
I remember a brief essay on sleep which appeared
in <cite>The New Witness</cite>—or, as it was then called,
<cite>The Eye Witness</cite>—several years ago, which was
not so much a complete work in itself as it was a
draft for a poem. It had the economy of phrase,
the concentration of idea, which is proper to poetry.</p>

<p>But it is not necessary in the case of Hilaire
Belloc, as it is in that of Walter Pater, to search
pages of prose for proof that their author is a poet.
Now and then—all too seldom—the idea in this
man’s brain has insisted on its right, has scorned the
proffered dress of prose, however fine of warp and
woof, however stiff with rich verbal embroidery, and
has demanded its rhymed and rhythmed wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
garments. Therefore, for proof that Hilaire Belloc
is a poet it is necessary only to read his poetry.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Hilaire Belloc is a poet. Also he is a Frenchman,
an Englishman, an Oxford man, a Roman Catholic,
a country gentleman, a soldier, a democrat, and a
practical journalist. He is always all these things.</p>

<p>One sign that he is naturally a poet is that he is
never deliberately a poet. No one can imagine him
writing a poem to order—even to his own order.
The poems knock at the door of his brain and demand
to be let out. And he lets them out, carelessly
enough, setting them comfortably down on
paper simply because that is the treatment they desire.
And this happens to be the way all real poetry
is made.</p>

<p>Not that all verse makers work that way. There
are men who come upon a waterfall or mountain or
an emotion and say: “Aha! here is something out of
which I can extract a poem!” And they sit down
in front of that waterfall or mountain or an emotion
and think up clever things to say about it.
These things they put into metrical form, and the
result they fondly call a poem.</p>

<p>There’s no harm in that. It’s good exercise for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the mind, and of it comes much interesting verse.
But it is not the way in which the sum of the world’s
literature is increased.</p>

<p>Could anything, for example, be less studied, be
more clearly marked with the stigmata of that noble
spontaneity we call inspiration, than the passionate,
rushing, irresistible lines “To the Balliol Men
Still in Africa”? Like Gilbert K. Chesterton and
many another English democrat, Hilaire Belloc
deeply resented his country’s war upon the Boers.
Yet his heart went out to the friends of his university
days who were fighting in Africa. They were
fighting, he thought, in an unjust cause; but they
were his friends and they were, at any rate, fighting.
And so he made something that seems (like all great
writing) an utterance rather than a composition;
he put his love of war in general and his hatred of
this war in particular, his devotion to Balliol and
to the friends of his youth into one of the very few
pieces of genuine poetry which the Boer War produced.
Nor has any of Oxford’s much-sung colleges
known praise more fit than this</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“House that armours a man</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With the eyes of a boy and the heart of a ranger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a laughing way in the teeth of the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a holy hunger and thirst for danger.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>
<p>But perhaps a more typical example of Hilaire
Belloc’s wanton genius is to be found not among
those poems which are, throughout, the beautiful expressions
of beautiful impressions, but among those
which are careless, whimsical, colloquial. There is
that delightful, but somewhat exasperating <cite>Dedicatory
Ode</cite>. Hilaire Belloc is talking—charmingly,
as is his custom—to some of his friends, who had
belonged, in their university days, to a youthful
revolutionary organisation called the Republican
Club. He happens to be talking in verse, for no
particular reason except that it amuses him to talk
in verse. He makes a number of excellent jokes,
and enjoys them very much; his Pegasus is cantering
down the road at a jolly gait, when suddenly, to
the amazement of the spectators, it spreads out
great golden wings and flashes like a meteor across
the vault of heaven! We have been laughing at the
droll tragedy of the opium-smoking Uncle Paul;
we have been enjoying the humorous spectacle of
the contemplative freshman—and suddenly we
come upon a bit of astonishingly fine poetry. Who
would expect, in all this whimsical and jovial writing,
to find this really great stanza?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“From quiet homes and first beginning</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Out to the undiscovered ends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s nothing worth the wear of winning</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But laughter and the love of friends.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Who having read these four lines, can forget
them? And who but a poet could write them? But
Hilaire Belloc has not forced himself into this
high mood, nor does he bother to maintain it. He
gaily passes on to another verse of drollery, and
then, not because he wishes to bring the poem to an
effective climax, but merely because it happens to
be his mood, he ends the escapade he calls an Ode
with eight or ten stanzas of nobly beautiful poetry.</p>

<p>There is something almost uncanny about the
flashes of inspiration which dart out at the astonished
reader of Hilaire Belloc’s most frivolous
verses. Let me alter a famous epigram and call
his light verse a circus illuminated by lightning.
There is that monumental burlesque, the Newdigate
Poem—<cite>A Prize Poem Submitted by Mr.
Lambkin of Burford to the Examiners of the University
of Oxford on the Prescribed Poetic Theme
Set by Them in 1893, “The Benefits of the Electric
Light.”</cite> It is a tremendous joke; with every
line the reader echoes the author’s laughter. But
without the slightest warning Hilaire Belloc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
passes from rollicking burlesque to shrewd satire;
he has been merrily jesting with a bladder on a stick,
he suddenly draws a gleaming rapier and thrusts it
into the heart of error. He makes Mr. Lambkin
say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Life is a veil, its paths are dark and rough</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only because we do not know enough:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Science has discovered something more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We shall be happier than we were before.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Here we find the directness and restraint which
belong to really great satire. This is the materialistic
theory, the religion of Science, not burlesqued,
not parodied, but merely stated nakedly, without
the verbal frills and furbelows with which our forward-looking
leaders of popular thought are accustomed
to cover its obscene absurdity. Almost
these very words have been uttered in a dozen “rationalistic”
pulpits I could mention, pulpits occupied
by robustuous practical gentlemen with very
large eyes, great favourites with the women’s clubs.
Their pet doctrine, their only and most offensive
dogma, is not attacked, is not ridiculed; it is merely
stated for them, in all kindness and simplicity.
They cannot answer it, they cannot deny that it is
a mercilessly fair statement of the “philosophy”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
that is their stock in trade. I hope that many of
them will read it.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Hilaire Belloc was born July 27, 1870. He
was educated at the Oratory School, Edgbaston,
and at Balliol College, Oxford. After leaving
school he served as a driver in the Eighth Regiment
of French Artillery at Toul Meurthe-et-Moselle,
being at that time a French citizen. Later
he was naturalised as a British subject, and entered
the House of Commons in 1906 as Liberal Member
for South Salford. British politicians will not
soon forget the motion which Hilaire Belloc introduced
one day in the early Spring of 1908, the motion
that the Party funds, hitherto secretly administered,
be publicly audited. His vigorous and persistent
campaign against the party system has
placed him, with Cecil Chesterton, in the very front
ranks of those to whom the democrats of Great
Britain must look for leadership and inspiration.
He was always a keen student of military affairs;
he prophesied, long before the event, the present international
conflict, describing with astonishing accuracy
the details of the German invasion of Belgium
and the resistance of Liège. Now he occupies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
a unique position among the journalists who
comment upon the War, having tremendously increased
the circulation of <cite>Land and Water</cite>, the
periodical for which he writes regularly, and lecturing
to a huge audience once a week on the events
of the War in one of the largest of London’s concert
halls—Queen’s Hall, where the same vast crowds
that listen to the War lectures used to gather to
hear the works of the foremost German composers.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Hilaire Belloc, as I have said, is a Frenchman,
an Englishman, an Oxford man, a country gentleman,
a soldier, a democrat, and a practical journalist.
In all these characters he utters his poetry.
As a Frenchman, he is vivacious and gallant and
quick. He has the noble English frankness, and
that broad irresistible English mirthfulness which
is so much more inclusive than that narrow possession,
a sense of humour. Democrat though he is,
there is about him something of the atmosphere of
the country squire of some generations ago; it is
in his heartiness, his jovial dignity, his deep love of
the land. The author of <cite>The South Country</cite> and
<cite>Courtesy</cite> has made Sussex his inalienable possession;
he owns Sussex, as Dickens owns London, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Blackmore owns Devonshire. And he is thoroughly
a soldier, a happy warrior, as brave and dexterous,
no one can doubt, with a sword of steel as
with a sword of words.</p>

<p>He has taken the most severe risk which a poet
can take: he has written poems about childhood.
What happened when the late Algernon Charles
Swinburne bent his energies to the task of celebrating
this theme? As the result of his solemn meditation
on the mystery of childhood, he arrived at two
conclusions, which he melodiously announced to the
world. They were, first, that the face of a baby
wearing a plush cap looks like a moss-rose bud in
its soft sheath, and, second, that “astrolabe” rhymes
with “babe.” Very charming, of course, but certainly
unworthy of a great poet. And upon this the
obvious comment is that Swinburne was not a great
poet. He took a theme terribly great and terribly
simple, and about it he wrote ... something
rather pretty.</p>

<p>Now, when a really great poet—Francis Thompson,
for example—has before him such a theme as
childhood, he does not spend his time making far-fetched
comparisons with moss-rose buds, or hunting
for words that rhyme with “babe.” Childhood
suggests Him Who made childhood sacred, so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
poet writes <cite lang="la">Ex Ore Infantium</cite>, or such a poem as
that which ends with the line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Look for me in the nurseries of Heaven.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">A poet may write pleasingly about mountains, and
cyclones and battles, and the love of woman, but if
he is at all timid about the verdict of posterity he
should avoid the theme of childhood as he would
avoid the plague. For only great poets can write
about childhood poems worthy to be printed.</p>

<p>Hilaire Belloc has written poems about children,
and they are worthy to be printed. He is never
ironic when he thinks about childhood; he is gay,
whimsical, with a slight suggestion of elfin cynicism,
but he is direct, as a child is direct. He has written
two dedicatory poems for books to be given to children;
they are slight things, but they are a revelation
of their author’s power to do what only a very
few poets can do, that is, to enter into the heart and
mind of the child, following that advice which has
its literary as well as moral significance, to “become
as a little child.”</p>

<p>And in many of Hilaire Belloc’s poems by no
means intended for childish audiences there is an
appealing simplicity that is genuinely and beautifully
childish, something quite different from the
adult and highly artificial simplicity of Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
A.&nbsp;E. Housman’s <cite>A Shropshire Lad</cite>. Take that
quatrain <cite>The Early Morning</cite>. It is as clear and
cool as the time it celebrates; it is absolutely destitute
of rhetorical indulgence, poetical inversions
or “literary” phrasing. It is, in fact, conversation—inspired
conversation, which is poetry. It might
have been written by a Wordsworth not painfully
self-conscious, or by a Blake whose brain was not
as yet muddled with impressionistic metaphysics.</p>

<p>And his Christmas carols—they are fit to be sung
by a chorus of children. Can any songs of the sort
receive higher praise than that? Children, too, appreciate
<cite>The Birds</cite> and <cite>Our Lord and Our Lady</cite>.
Nor is that wonderful prayer rather flatly called
<cite>In a Boat</cite> beyond the reach of their intelligence.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, Hilaire Belloc is strongly
drawn to the almost violent simplicity of the ballad.
Bishop Percy would not have enjoyed the theological
and political atmosphere of <cite>The Little Serving
Maid</cite>, but he would have acknowledged its irresistible
charm. There is that wholly delightful poem
<cite>The Death and Last Confession of Wandering
Peter</cite>—a most Bellocian vagabond. “He wandered
everywhere he would: and all that he approved was
sung, and most of what he saw was good.” Says
Peter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“If all that I have loved and seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be with me on the Judgment Day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shall be saved the crowd between</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From Satan and his foul array.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hilaire Belloc has seen much and loved much.
He has sung lustily the things he approved—with
what hearty hatred has he sung the things he disapproved!</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Hilaire Belloc is not the man to spend much time
in analysing his own emotions; he is not, thank God,
a poetical psychologist. Love songs, drinking
songs, battle songs—it is with these primitive and
democratic things that he is chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>But there is something more democratic than
wine or love or war. That thing is Faith. And
Hilaire Belloc’s part in increasing the sum of the
world’s beauty would not be the considerable thing
that it is were it not for his Faith. It is not that
(like Dante Gabriel Rossetti) he is attracted by the
Church’s pageantry and wealth of legend. To
Hilaire Belloc the pageantry is only incidental, the
essential thing is his Catholic Faith. He writes convincingly
about Our Lady and Saint Joseph and
the Child Jesus because he himself is convinced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
He does not delve into mediæval tradition in quest
of picturesque incidents, he merely writes what he
knows to be true. His Faith furnishes him with the
theme for those of his poems which are most likely
to endure; his Faith gives him the “rapture of an inspiration.”
His Faith enables him, as it has enabled
many another poet, to see “in the lamp that is
beauty, the light that is God.”</p>

<p>And therein is Hilaire Belloc most thoroughly
and consistently a democrat. For in this twentieth
century it happens that there is on earth only one
genuine democratic institution. And that institution
is the Catholic Church.</p>

Mlle. Coppin, a distinguished Belgian
poetess, who now, like so many of her compatriots,
is a refugee in London, said: “I believe we have
been too prosperous, too fond of pleasure. We are
being purged, and in our adversity we have found
our nationality. If ever England, France, and
Russia make a new Belgium, we shall be more
simple and hard-working.”</p>

<p>Those of us who believe that the character of a
nation is, to a great extent, revealed in its literature
cannot doubt that Mlle. Coppin’s words are true.
Surely the sick fancies of Maurice Maeterlinck (to
mention the most conspicuous of Belgian men of
letters) could come into being only in a land suffering
from over-much civilisation, in a land whose
citizens are too sophisticated for common and wholesome
delights. Even more than the elaborate obscenities
of Iwan Gilkin and Albert Giraud,
Maeterlinck’s morbid studies of mental, spiritual,
and physical degradation belong to that sort of literature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
which is called “decadent.” And decadent
literature usually is produced for and by people
who need to be, in Mlle. Coppin’s words, “more
simple and hard-working.”</p>

<p>That the great tragedy which has overtaken Belgium
will have a beneficial effect upon its literature
is not to be doubted. Of course, the first result is
an almost total cessation of creative activity; one
cannot handle a rifle and a pen at the same time.
But with the return of peace must come the development
of a new Belgian literature, a literature which
is not an echo of the salon-philosophies of Paris and
Berlin, but a beautiful expression of the soul of a
strong and brave race.</p>

<p>It is possible that when the poets of a re-created
Belgium are singing their clear songs, the world,
comparing them with Gilkin, Giraud, Maeterlinck,
and the Verhaeren of <cite lang="fr">Les Débâcles</cite> and <cite lang="fr">Les Flambeaux
Noirs</cite>, will say: “Now, for the first time, Belgian
poetry deserves the attention of those who are
interested in other than the pathological aspects of
literature! Not until the land had been purified by
blood and flame did the Spirit of Beauty come to
dwell in Flanders!”</p>

<p>But this criticism will be unjust. Great literary
movements do not spontaneously come into being;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
they develop slowly and surely through the centuries.
If all the poetry of Belgium were the work
of charlatans and vicious men, then, not even this
tremendous war could stimulate it into healthy life.
The fame of Maeterlinck’s dismal dramas, and of
the least worthy poems of Emile Verhaeren, should
not make us oblivious of the fact that Belgium has,
and has always had, its small, but brilliant, company
of sincere and gifted writers, men who have not debased
their art, but have held in honour the sacred
traditions of their high calling. He who, neglecting
the productions of the symbolists, decadents,
and similar phantasists, turns his attention to the
authentic literature of the Belgian people, finds a
strain of poetry white and beautiful, and as fervently
Catholic as the immortal songs of Crashaw
and Francis Thompson. It is not the disciples of
Baudelaire and Mallarmé who have planted the
seeds of poetry that soon shall burst into splendid
bloom, but men like Thomas Braun and Georges
Ramaekers, men who, serving faithfully their Muse,
have never wavered in their allegiance to the Mistress
of all the Arts, the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that these poets write only
religious poems. They have, indeed, produced such
masterpieces of devotional verse as Braun’s <cite lang="fr">Livre
des Bénédictions</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> and Ramaekers’ <cite lang="fr">Le Chant des
Trois Regnes</cite>. But when their poetry is not religious
it is not, at any rate, irreligious; they “utter
nothing base.” And surely even the lightest of
secular poems may do its author’s Catholicism no
discredit. As Francis Thompson said of poetry
in the eloquent appeal to the “fathers of the Church,
pastors of the Church, pious laics of the Church”
with which his most famous essay begins, “Eye her
not askance if she seldom sing directly of religion:
the bird gives glory to God though it sings only of
its own innocent loves.... Suffer her to wanton,
suffer her to play, so she play round the foot of the
Cross!”</p>

<p>Indeed, what is true of much modern English
verse is true also of that of Belgium, there are Catholic
poets who seldom in their work refer directly
to their faith, and there are infidel poets who have
laid impious hands on the Church’s treasures and
decorate their rhymes with rich ecclesiastical imagery
and the fragrant names of the Saints. So we
find, for example, Emile Verhaeren using the first
chapters of Genesis as the theme of a poem that is
anything but edifying, while that pious Catholic,
Thomas Braun, writes a volume of verses about
postage stamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>There are certain optimistic persons who believe
that the general use in literature of sacred names
and traditions augurs well for the spread of faith.
A member of an Anglican religious order, who two
years ago delivered a series of lectures in New York
City, prophesied a mighty recrudescence of religion
among the poets of England, and based his prophecy,
apparently, on the fact that Mr. Lascelles
Abercrombie and other brilliant young writers have
made ballads out of some of the most picturesque of
the legends about the Saints. He did not see that
Mr. Abercrombie selected his themes solely because
of their literary value. There are many poets who
eagerly avail themselves of the stores which are the
Church’s heritage, who introduce the name of the
Blessed Virgin into their verses exactly as they
would introduce that of Diana, or Venus or any
creature of fable. Personally, I have never been
able to enjoy the recital, however skillful, of a
sacred story by a poet who did not believe in it, and
therefore I cannot grow enthusiastic over the
knowledge that many Belgian poets, whose philosophies
are hostile to the Church, like to write about
monstrances and chalices and altars, and to tell
ostentatiously “human” stories about sacred people
in general and St. Mary Magdalen in particular.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
I find Thomas Braun’s poems about postage
stamps more edifying.</p>

<p>The modern Catholic poets of Belgium may be
roughly divided into two groups, the mystics and
the primitives. These terms are here used merely
for the purposes of this classification, and cannot
perhaps be justified by scientific criticism. Among
the mystics I would include such writers as Georges
Ramaekers, the brilliant editor of <cite lang="fr">Le Catholique</cite>,
and perhaps Max Elskamp, who use elaborate and
complicated symbols, and, in general, may be said
to do in verse what the late Joris Karl Huysmans,
after his conversion to Catholicism, did in prose.
Among the primitives I would place such poets as
Victor Kinon and Thomas Braun, who look for
their inspirations to the ancient religious life of
Flanders, in all its picturesque simplicity, and are
more concerned with celebrating the piety of simple
Flemish peasants than with endeavouring to penetrate
high mysteries.</p>

<p>It is to that valued friend of Belgian letters, Mr.
Jethro Bithell, of Birbeck College, London, whose
translation of Stefan Zweig’s book on Verhaeren
has recently earned him the gratitude of the English-speaking
public, that we owe this excellent version
of Thomas Braun’s <cite>The Benediction of the
Nuptial Ring</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>, taken from this poet’s <cite>The Book of
the Benedictions</cite>. The directness and sincerity of
this poem suggest the work of George Herbert.</p>

<p class="poetry-heading">THE BENEDICTION OF THE NUPTIAL KING</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In many of Thomas Braun’s poems is to be found
a quality suggestive of the folk song. Like the Verhaeren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of <cite lang="fr">Les Flamandes</cite>, Braun writes of those
huge, boisterous farmers and merchants who live
for us on the canvases of Brauwer and Jan Steen.
But he writes of them, it need scarcely be said, in a
very different spirit. Verhaeren saw only their
gluttony, drunkenness, and coarseness; Braun sees
their courage, industry, good-nature, piety. In
fact, Verhaeren saw their bodies, Braun sees their
souls.</p>

<p>In an essay on Verhaeren recently printed, I
called attention to the fact that while Verhaeren
wrote of the Flemings with enthusiasm, and with
repulsively careful attention to detail, he did not
write of them with sympathy. He does not join in
the revels about which he writes; he is interested in
his loud purple-faced peasants, but with his interest
is mingled a certain scorn. Thomas Braun, on the
other hand, is thoroughly in sympathy with the life
of which he writes; the reader feels that such a poem
as <cite>The Benediction of Wine</cite>, for example, was written
by a man who is artist enough to share actually
in the strong simple piety of the keeper of the vineyard.
The quaintness of Thomas Braun’s poems,
which is emphasized by the woodcuts made to accompany
them by his brother who is a Benedictine
monk, is not an affectation, it is a quality proper to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the work of a man who, like Wordsworth, sees
beauty chiefly in simplicity. Like Coventry Patmore,
he has “divine frivolity,” he is acquainted with
the mirth of the Saints. In his own beautiful
words, he knows how to play in the straw with the
Child of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Georges Ramaekers is a poet whose verse is for
the most part too obscure to lend itself readily to
translation. He will write a poem, for example, on
mushrooms, and the reader will think after several
minutes that he is being told merely about the common
fungi. Then it comes to him that it is the Tree
of Life that these maleficent growths are attacking;
then they cover the columns of the Church and actually
reach the Host Itself. The poem is, it seems, a
denunciation of certain heresies, or of sloth, indifference,
and other spiritual evils, but its meaning cannot
adequately be given in an English translation.</p>

<p>Here is a similar poem, which, in Mr. Bithell’s
translation, shows Georges Ramaeker’s symbolic
method at its best and clearest.</p>

<p class="poetry-heading">THE THISTLE</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Rooted on herbless peaks, where its erect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prickly leaves, austerely cold and dumb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hold the slow, scaly serpent in respect,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Gothic thistle, while the insects’ hum</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sounds far off, rears above the rock it scorns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its rigid virtue for the Heavens to see.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The towering boulders guard it. And the bee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes honey from the blossoms on its thorns.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Victor Kinon, like that very different poet, Albert
Giraud, the chief Belgian disciple of Baudelaire,
is of Walloon descent. Mr. Bithell calls this
poet a “fervent Roman Catholic,” but the poems
which he has selected for translation are entirely
secular in theme and treatment. They show, however,
that their author is free from the vices of extreme
realism and hysteria, which afflict many of his
contemporaries. Sometimes it is fair to judge a
poet’s whole attitude toward life from his love
poems. When decadence and feverish eroticism are
in fashion, it is refreshing to come upon a poet sane
enough to write so honest and delicate a poem as this
of Victor Kinon.</p>

<p class="poetry-heading">HIDING FROM THE WORLD</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall not our love be like the violet, Sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And open in the dewy, dustless air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its dainty chalice with blue petals, where</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shade of bushes makes a shy retreat?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we will frame our daily happiness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By joining hearts, lips, brows in rapt caress</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far from the world, its noises and conceit.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall we not hide our modest love between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trees wafting cool on flowers and grasses green?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Victor Kinon’s poetry is shown a knowledge
of nature like that possessed by that American poet
whose death the world of letters has not ceased to
mourn, Madison Cawein. He sketches a landscape
in a few vigorous lines, and the picture is vivid and
true. This little poem might be a lyrical rendition
of a Monet painting.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to resist the temptation to read into
the Catholic fold many Belgian poets who do not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
perhaps, belong there. There is scarcely a man of
letters in Belgium who does not owe his introduction
to literature to the Catholic Church. The
Catholic schools and universities of Belgium have
given a knowledge of art and poetry to many a poet
who now pays for the gift his little stanzas of abuse.
But some of them, and among them must be counted
Emile Verhaeren, seem to be thinking of their old
faith, now that the need of faith has become terribly
apparent to them. Verhaeren, especially, seems to
be about to stop in his weary flight from the Hound
of Heaven. For many years he was a writer of
poems that seemed to betray a mind absolutely diseased.
There were realistic studies of human vice
that seemed like pages of Zola done into verse, and
there were extraordinary attempts (of which Stefan
Zweig speaks approvingly) to “chisel a new face
of God.” But since his retirement to his little cottage
at Caillou-qui-Bique, he has written poems
that are for the most part exaltations of pure love,
as lofty in thought as they are finished in composition.
Mr. Bithell’s translation of this little song
of wedded love shows that Verhaeren has left far
behind him the grossness of <cite lang="fr">Les Flamandes</cite> and the
morbidness of <cite lang="fr">Les Flambeaux Noirs</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent2">I hear all her soul, I surprise</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">This is the good hour when the lamp is lit.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">The flower that one has seen</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the heart will of a sudden thrill and glow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remembering some faded word of love</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Found in a drawer beneath a cast-off glove</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a letter of a year ago.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the poem which indicates most clearly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
tremendous change that his nation’s tragedy has
brought to Verhaeren, is that inspired by the demolition
of the Cathedral of Rheims. A year ago,
it may be, Verhaeren would have thought of this
cathedral merely as a beautiful piece of architecture,
as an ancient and lovely landmark. Now that
it has suffered from the cannon of an invading
army, he remembers suddenly the high use for which
it was intended, the destruction of the sacred images
and vessels reminds him, in spite of all his
sophistry, that these things were not mere works of
art. Once more, as in those far-away years when,
with Georges Rodenbach, Charles Van Lerberghe,
and Maurice Maeterlinck, he learned of literature
and life at the Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe, he
is able to understand that most necessary of all acts,
worship. The poem is so significant, so important
to all who desire an insight into the psychology of
Verhaeren and of literary Belgium, that I venture
to quote here my own translation of it. It by no
means does justice to the beauty of the original.</p>

<p>Of Verhaeren’s school-fellows at Sainte-Barbe,
one, Maurice Maeterlinck, is already enjoying a
fame which exceeds his deserts and is not likely to
endure. Georges Rodenbach, who died in 1898,
wrote, like Verhaeren, of Flemish peasants, but he
gave them a romantic glamour which has alienated
critics who admire naturalistic poetry. Stefan
Zweig has little use for him, and Jethro Bithell
speaks of his “weary Alexandrines,” and says that
his reputation has waned considerably since his
death. But Charles C. Clarke, of the Sheffield
Scientific School, in the course of an illuminating
article on Belgian literature, says that Rodenbach’s
poems have considerable vogue in France. From
his discussion of Rodenbach I quote this felicitously
phrased paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Morbid and mystic like his prose, Rodenbach’s
poetry has a delicacy and a silvery tone that are inimitable.
Out of almost nothing it weaves thoughts
and calls up memories of wonderfully melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
beauty. In it water is always stagnant, giving chill
reflections of the sky through trees; lights are dim,
footsteps noiseless; rooms are repositories of reminders
of the past, where silence speaks to the
heart through sad aspects. The extent to which
Rodenbach uses such notes constitutes his originality.
His skill in avoiding every common formula
and his delicate choice of metaphors seem really inspiration.
No one has imitated his poems of gray
tints and muffled sounds, his mourning designs of
dull filigree, without falling into monotony and
trifling. It is not enough praise for a poet to say of
him that he was unapproachable in picturing the
accessories of melancholy; but Rodenbach deserves
no more, unless it be our gratitude for preserving in
literature something of ancient Flanders which
battle and flame have destroyed beyond material
restoration.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another school-fellow of Verhaeren, Charles Van
Lerberghe, can scarcely, I believe, be called a Catholic
poet, although, like Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
whose disciple he was, his verse is filled with Catholic
symbolism. In a country like Belgium, in
which nearly all the education is Catholic, and in
which nearly every poet is, at any rate nominally,
a Catholic, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between
writers who have a genuinely devotional
spirit, and those who merely like to play with mysticism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
There are, for example, the amazing poems
of Max Elskamp. He writes simple and charming
poems about the Blessed Virgin and the Christ
Child, and seems, indeed, to have the hardy faith of
his Flemish ancestors. But the simplicity of his
poems is not always convincing; the reader remembers
that the late William Sharpe wrote, as “Fiona
MacLeod,” poems that seemed to flame with all the
piety of the Gael. And William Sharpe was, as he
took care to let the world know, a “pagan.” The
feeling that Elskamp’s interest in religion is chiefly
literary is strengthened when we learn from Mr.
Bithell that most of the sacred names in his poems
have a symbolic meaning, that the Blessed Virgin
means merely “the pure woman,” and the Christ
Child simply “the delicious infancy.” Intellectual
caprices like this seldom accompany genuine devotional
feeling.</p>

<p>But at any rate there is nothing to disgust or pain
the reader in Elskamp’s verse; whether or not he
believes in the sacred personages of whom he writes,
he does not treat them irreverently. His Catholicism,
however, is not so convincing as is that of
Thomas Braun and Georges Ramaekers.</p>

<p>It is good to find that in Belgium, a country the
literature of which must inevitably reflect from time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
to time the strange fashions of Germany and
France, there has been preserved through the years
the poetry of Catholic tradition. Belgian poetry
must become more and more spiritual; the poets
have seen and felt things mighty and terrible, and
they can no longer concern themselves with erotic
fancies and the nuances of their own emotions. In
days to come, historians of literature will perhaps
see that on the thought of Belgium as on the thought
of all Europe, this war has had a clarifying and
strengthening effect. Good still comes from evil,
sweetness from force, and honeycomb out of the
lion’s carcass. Belgium may say, in the words of
one of the truest poets of our time:</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Shaemas:</p>

<p>I have been thinking a good deal about you for
the last day or so, and might therefore have known
that a message from you was on its way. The Minaret
is a fine adventure, and God knows Washington
needs adventures more than any other city in
the United States. There is some beautiful writing
and some brave and direct thinking in the copies you
sent me, and of course I enclose my subscription for
a year. I’d support any enterprise of yours, so
long as it wasn’t a scheme to make the Kaiser
Mayor of Mahwah, New Jersey. I also enclose a
poem, with my blessing.</p>

<p>But why do you let your young collaborator—I
suppose he is responsible—be so damned vindictive!
No poet has any right in the world to knock the
work of another poet who is honest. Vachel Lindsey
is, in my opinion, a sincere artist, whose work
sometimes—as in “The Chinese Nightingale”—glows
with genius. That is of course only my own
opinion—but it is not merely a matter of opinion,
but a matter of absolute fact, that he is an honest
man, consistently serving his ideal, earnestly endeavouring
to express the beauty that is in him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
And abuse is not what he should receive from his
brother poet.</p>

<p>However, go ahead, and good luck to you. But
lay off the hammer! Poets have enough to suffer
without being castigated by other poets. Keep out
of jail, and give my love to Blanche and Patrick
Wilhelm.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Sara:</p>

<p>I don’t know that POETRY could use a Valentine
poem, but if it could do so, it ought by all means
to use it long after Valentine’s day, for timeliness,
the greatest curse of our much cursed magazines, is
certainly not one of POETRY’S vices. And how
do you like it? It’s the first free verse I’ve written
since free verse made a special label for itself—it’s
a highly artificial poem, and yet passionately sincere.</p>

<p>I’ve quit being a critic, thank God! I resigned
from the <i>Bookman</i> and <i>Book News Monthly</i>, and
I no longer review poetry for the <i>Times</i>. I still run
the <i>Digest’s</i> “Current Poetry” department, but
that’s not criticism, it’s just an exhibition. I merely
hold up for admiration the best poetry I can find,
saying nothing about inferior stuff. And I can do
that without losing my self-respect. But criticism
of poetry is no task for an enthusiastic poet, however
little he may deserve the title.</p>

<p>Aline is still in hospital, impatient for the new
baby. She likes to receive letters.</p>

<p>It is delightful to find on my desk this morning

Of course I am reading with enjoyment the
“Opera” in <cite>America</cite>; how valuable a friend Catholic
poetry, that is poetry, has in you!</p>

<p>A verse-maker, I suppose, is an unskillful critic
of his own work. But in reply to your question, I
will say that I am greatly pleased when people
like “Trees,” “Stars” and “Pennies,” when they
see that “Folly” is a religious poem, when they
praise the stanza fourth from the end of “Delicatessen,”
and understand stanza three of section four
of “The Fourth Shepherd.”</p>

<p>Before what Miss Guiney calls my “great leap
into Liberty” I published a book of verses called
“Summer of Love”; but I do not think it would
interest you; it is, for the most part, a celebration of
common themes. If you have not a copy of “Trees
and Other Poems” please tell me and I will send
you one. I will send also “Summer of Love” if you
wish it, for some of the poems in it, those inspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
by genuine love, are not things of which to be
ashamed, and you, understanding, would not be
offended by the others.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Katherine:</p>

<p>Naturally I’m expecting to go to the Wars,
being of appropriate age and sex. I was going to
Plattsburg to try for a commission, but for many
reasons—one of them being that I didn’t want to be
an officer in charge of conscripts (the democratic
bluff again! says Katherine)—I gave up the idea.
So a month ago I enlisted as a private in the Seventh
Regiment, National Guard, New York. We
were reviewed by your friend Joffre—in 1824 we
were reviewed by Lafayette. We go to training
camp in a week or so—where I don’t know—and
then we are mustered into Federal service. We
may be sent to France, we may be sent to Russia,
or it may be Mexico or Cuba—nobody knows.</p>

<p>Please come to New York and let me take you
to luncheon. And give Mrs. Coates my love.</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Josephine:</p>

<p>That is a magnificent piece of knitting—I am
delighted to own it. Thanks ever so much! And
I will thank you ever more for your book of poetry,
which you promise to send me. I enjoyed your
recent poems in the <cite>Outlook</cite>—you are one of the
few American poets who should be allowed to write
war songs. Your letter came up to the specifications
of the order—it was highly entertaining and
therefore genuinely appreciated. I sympathise
with you in your trials in addressing camp audiences,
though I don’t know as you deserve any sympathy.
I think you have a pretty good time. And
I know the audiences do.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised to hear of you coming
over here as a nurse or something. Nice country,
nice war. I wouldn’t be back in the States having
meatless, wheatless, boozeless, smokeless days for
anything. I am a Sergeant now. I spend my time
working at Regimental Headquarters while we are
in reserve, and in training and when we are in action
I am an Observer in the Regimental Intelligence
Section—very amusing work. I had a fine time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
during the recent activities of our regiment, activities
of which you probably read in the papers. In
the dug-out I wrote a poem I think you’ll like—“Rouge
Bouquet” is its name. I expect to remain a
Sergeant (unless I’m reduced), for to get a commission
I’d have to leave the Regiment and go to a
training school for several months and then I would
be sent to some regiment other than this. And I’d
rather be a sergeant in the 69th than a lieutenant in
any other outfit.</p>

<p>Give my love to anybody you meet who would
appreciate that commodity. And write often to</p>

</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Mr. Cook:</p>

<p>Your letter of May 31 has just arrived. I am
afraid that such information as I can send you will
reach you too late to be of use, but anyway I’ll do
what I can.</p>

<p>You ask first for biographical details. All this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
material you will find in Who’s Who in America,
except the information that I am the father of four
children, named respectively Kenton Sinclair,
Deborah Clanton, Michael Barry and Christopher.</p>

<p>Second, you ask for comments on myself and
something about my earlier efforts in poetry.
That’s harder to answer. How can I make comments
on myself? I’ll pass up that part of the questionnaire,
if I may, but I’m willing to write about
my earlier efforts in poetry. They were utterly
worthless, that is, all of them which preceded a
poem called “Pennies” which you will find in my
book “Trees and Other Poems.” I want all my
poems written before that to be forgotten—they
were only the exercises of an amateur, imitations,
useful only as technical training. If what I nowadays
write is considered poetry, then I became a
poet in November, 1913.</p>

<p>Now, as to your other questions. I’ll take them
in order. 1. What has contemporary poetry already
accomplished? Answer—All that poetry can
be expected to do is to give pleasure of a noble sort
to its readers, leading them to the contemplation of
that Beauty which neither words nor sculptures nor
pigments can do more than faintly reflect, and to
express the mental and spiritual tendencies of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
people of the lands and times in which it is written.
I have very little chance to read contemporary
poetry out here, but I hope it is reflecting the virtues
which are blossoming on the blood-soaked soil
of this land—courage, and self-abnegation, and
love, and faith—this last not faith in some abstract
goodness, but faith in God and His Son and the
Holy Ghost, and in the Church which God Himself
founded and still rules. France has turned to
her ancient Faith with more passionate devotion
than she has shown for centuries. I believe that
America is learning the same lesson from the war,
and is cleansing herself of cynicism and pessimism
and materialism and the lust for novelty which has
hampered our national development. I hope that
our poets already see this tendency and rejoice in
it—if they do not they are unworthy of their craft.</p>

<p>2. What is American poetry’s influence to-day?
Answer—This question I am ill-prepared to answer,
but I would venture to surmise that the extravagances
and decadence of the so-called “renascence
of poetry” during the last five years—a
renascence distinguished by the celebration of the
queer and the nasty instead of the beautiful—have
made the poet seem as silly a figure to the contemporary
American as he seemed to the Englishman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
of the eighteen-nineties, when the “æsthetic
movement” was at its foolish height.</p>

<p>3. What of American poetry’s future? Answer—To
predict anything of American poetry’s future
requires a knowledge of America’s future, and I am
not a student of political economy. But this much
I will tell you—when we soldiers get back to our
homes and have the leisure to read poetry, we won’t
read the works of Amy Lowell and Edgar Lee
Masters. We’ll read poetry, if there is any for us
to read, and I hope there will be. I believe there
will.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Tom:</p>

<p>Where will you be, I wonder, when this letter
reaches you? Perhaps in the Brooklyn sanctuary
(this term is here used in a purely literary sense)
reading reviews of your newest book of verse—pleasant
reading indeed, judging by those I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
seen. Perhaps you will be in your Sabine farm at
Lake Hopatkong—if that is the way that strange
word is spelled. Perhaps the postman will give it to
you just as you parade away from your home, and
you will take it with you to the palatial new Columbia
University Club, and glance at it over your
turtle soup and sherry and steak and mushrooms
and corn and sweet potatoes and chaveis—but I’m
breaking my heart describing this meal of yours.
Soon the mess call will sound and I’ll take my aluminum
meat dish and canteen cup, and wade
through the mud to the mess-line. And I’ll get a
plate of stew and some milkless tea or coffee, and
I’ll stand in the mud or sit down in the mud and
consume it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it’s a nice war and I’m enjoying
most of it. Our time at the front—of which the
newspapers have by this time informed you—was
a wonderful experience. I had the privilege of
spending a week as observer in the Regimental
Intelligence Section—lively and interesting work.
I’d love to see you at an observation post, Tom,
you’d get as thin as I now am.</p>

<p>Send me your book, will you, Tom? I enjoy
poetry more now than ever before—I suppose it is
because I get it so seldom. When I’m writing verse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and reviewing verse and talking about verse and to
verse-makers all the time, I have not the enthusiasm
for it I have over here, where most of the poetry
is unwritten and undiscussed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it’s a nice country. I’d like to buy
you a litre of red wine—for a franc and a half—with
a dash of syrup in it. Also I could introduce
you to the results of the labours of a few accomplished
cooks, some of them soldiers, some of them
French women.</p>

<p>Fr. O’Donnell quotes you to the effect that Louis
is now in this land, or on his way hither. I hope to
see him. He ought to be sent to an Officer’s Training
School soon—I think that will happen. He is
the sort of fellow who ought to have a commission.
I might possibly be allowed to go to an Officer’s
Training School, but I wouldn’t do so, because if I
did so I’d be sent—whether or not I got a commission—to
some Regiment other than this. And I
take no pleasure in the thought of soldiering in a
regiment of strangers. I like the crowd in this outfit
very much and would rather be a sergeant—as
I am—here than be a lieutenant in any other Regiment.</p>

<p>If you are ever minded to send me papers, please
let them be <i>Times</i> Book Reviews or other sheets of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
a decidedly literary flavour. Occasional copies of
<i>The Bookman</i> would be welcome. I like a bit of
concentrated literature now and then.</p>

and to any of my other friends whom you may
meet. And believe me</p>

enjoyed and expect to enjoy during many re-readings.
What I write now is merely a note in answer
to your letter of April 12. This you will please
communicate to Mr. Doran and regard as final.</p>

<p>The only way I can give you any material for a
book is as I am doing now—sending you every six
months or so some verses or an introspective essay
which you can syndicate and eventually turn into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
book. I sent you a prose sketch “Holy Ireland”
(which represents the best prose writing I can do
nowadays), another prose sketch, and (by way of
Aline) a poem, “Rouge Bouquet,” which you ought
to be able to do a good deal with. It is probably the
best verse I have written. I never planned doing
war-correspondence work—if I had I’d have come
over as a correspondent instead of as a soldier.
Many circumstances, including the censorship, the
rules governing a soldier’s conduct and other things,
prevent me from trying to make a consecutive narrative
now, even if I so desired. I am a poet at
present trying to be a soldier. The experience may
naturally be expected to result in a book—of some
kind, at some time. I am not going to try to
“cover” the war or my Regiment’s share in it. But
the title “Here and There With the Fighting Sixty-ninth”
may probably be taken as well as any other
to cover what, if I survive, I shall probably, in the
course of time, write. My days of hack writing are
over, for a time at least.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I am not at all interested in
writing nowadays, except in so far as writing is the
expression of something beautiful. And I see daily
and nightly the expression of beauty in action instead
of words, and I find it more satisfactory. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
am a Sergeant in the Regimental Intelligence Section—the
most fascinating work possible—more
thrills in it than in any other branch except possibly
aviation. And it’s more varied than aviation.
Wonderful life! But I don’t know what I’ll be able
to do in civilian life—unless I become a fireman!</p>

<p>Please give my love to Stella and believe me always
your affectionate and grateful friend</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Father:</p>

<p>I have to thank you for three letters, for two
poems, for the proof sheets of your book and for
your beautiful Christmas gift, which I treasure and
have with me always. The poem “To Rose in
Heaven” is so exquisite that I cannot write or speak
all my deep appreciation of it. But I know that it
is not my personal feeling alone that makes me
consider it one of the noblest elegiac poems in our
language. I wish that I were still in the book-reviewing
game—I’d like to express my opinion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
your new book. My column in the <i>Literary Digest</i>
is now conducted by Mrs. Edwin Markham.
However, I occasionally send in some clippings and
comment, and I’ll try to get some of your book
quoted. I congratulate you on your book; it is an
achievement for which you must be deeply grateful;
of course none of us rhymers can really be proud
if we’re true to the traditions of our craft. You see,
I’m not in “The Proud Poet” mood now. I’m
neither proud nor a poet—I’ve written only one
poem since I sailed, a little thing called “Militis
Meditatio.”</p>

<p>We all are well and happy—I do not think that
any one of us can honestly say that he has not enjoyed
this Winter. The trials and hardships of the
life are so novel as to be interesting. But I imagine
that one enjoys very little his tenth year of soldiering.
It is especially pleasant to be in France and
the part of France that we are in. I am surprised,
I acknowledge, by the passionate Catholicity of the
people. Even “Holy Ireland” can scarcely be more
Catholic than rural France.</p>

<p>Tell my friends my address and urge them to
write to me. Pray for me, and believe me always</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Father:</p>

<p>It is very comfortable to dwell in so genuinely
Catholic a land as this; to be reminded in every
room of every house, and at every cross-road of the
Faith. I do not know when you last visited France,
and perhaps you are already familiar with conditions
here, but I do not cease to be surprised and delighted
to see the number of people receiving Holy
Communion not only on Sunday, but every day.
And you will find soldiers of this Regiment in
church whenever and wherever there is a priest to
say Mass. I think that most of us are better Catholics
now than when we were at home—certainly we
should be.</p>

<p>My own work is growing steadily more interesting.
For a while I worked, as you know, in the Adjutant’s
Office, having special charge of recording
and reporting statistics. But this I gave up recently
to enter (as a Sergeant) the Regimental Intelligence
Section. This is much better for me,
since it is open-air work of an intensely interesting
kind, and I think that I am now more useful to the
Regiment. My newspaper training, you see, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
made me a competent observer, and that is what I
am nowadays—an observer of the enemy’s activities.
I have already some strange stories to tell,
but for telling them I must await a time when censorship
rules are abrogated. I have written very
little—two prose sketches and two poems since I
left the States—but I have a rich store of memories.
Not that what I write matters—I have discovered,
since some unforgettable experiences, that writing
is not the tremendously important thing I once considered
it. You will find me less a bookman when
you next see me, and more, I hope, a man.</p>

<p>Pray for me, my dear Father, that I may love
God more and that I may be unceasingly conscious
of Him—that is the greatest desire I have.</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>I hope that I interpret your letter of September
20th correctly in thinking that it means that you
will permit me to write to you occasionally, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
that you will write me in return. Of course I know
that your work occupies much of your time, and
that you have pleasanter uses for your leisure than
writing letters to some one you have not seen. So
do not feel obliged by courtesy to answer me at
length.</p>

<p>I am glad that you like some of my work. My
present occupation is that of assistant editor of <i>The
Churchman</i>, an Anglican weekly paper. It is a
Church Newspaper, with some literary features.
Did Grey tell you that I was not of your Communion?
I hope that this knowledge will not shut me
out of your regard.</p>

<p>Your remarks, in your letter, on the fact that
many of our most famous writers to-day are anti-Christian,
are certainly justified. Still, do you not
think that a reaction is coming? Already we have
Chesterton, and Belloc, and Bazin, and Miss
Guiney, and Fr. Vincent McNabb, and a number of
other brilliant writers who not as theologians but
purely as literary artists express a fine and wholesome
faith. People are beginning to tire of cheap
eroticism and “realism” and similar absurdities.</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>The cards are rather laconic, but they are supposed
to convey the information, as you thought,
that my family is the larger by one. I have already
a little boy, who will be four next March. His name
is Kenton Sinclair. I married when I was twenty-one,
immediately after my graduation from Columbia.
Then—since you have twice asked for biographical
information—I taught school in Morristown
for a year, came to New York, went to work
on the Standard Dictionary, and after three years
took my present position on <i>The Churchman</i>.</p>

<p>Do you know the Rev. Michael Earls? I recently
received a copy of his book of verse. He
is a member of your Society—I think he is at
Georgetown. The poems about children are very
delicate and sympathetic—one called, I believe,
“An Autumn Rose-bush” is admirable.</p>

<p>I see Grey frequently—I hope to take breakfast
with him to-morrow. A number of us have the custom
of breakfasting on Sunday mornings on the excellent
Irish bacon to be procured at Healy’s, on
91st St. When you return to New York, you must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
join us. Do you know Thomas Walsh? He is with
us occasionally—you should know him, and his
translations from the Spanish, and his verse. I
hope you are coming East soon.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>I do not like to burden my friends with my
troubles, but you have certain opportunities that I
lack, so I am asking you the greatest favour.
Please pray for the healing of my little daughter
Rose. She is dangerously ill with infantile paralysis.
This is a disease that has appeared among mankind
only recently, and physicians are uncertain
how to treat it. She is staying in New York with
her mother to be near the doctor and I am staying
here nights to take care of my other child. Of
course the maid is here during the day so the house
is kept up. But Rose cannot move her legs or arms—She
was so active and happy only last week—she
cannot even cry—her voice is just a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
whimper—the danger is of its reaching her lungs
and killing her. I cannot write any more. You
know how I feel. Pray for her.</p>

</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>There is not, it seems, any danger of the death
of Rose now. And she has regained her strength.
Her arms and legs have been left paralysed but her
hands and feet move. It will take a year’s time for
us to know whether or not this paralysis is permanent.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to you for your compliance
with my request. I know that your prayers were of
value in keeping her alive. Apologies for the
brusqueness of my letter asking your aid, are, I
think, not necessary—you were the only man to
whom I could appeal for the special help needed,
and I was in bitter grief and anxiety.</p>

<p>My wife asks me to express her sincere gratitude
to you.</p>

<p>Now that the crisis is past, we have a strange
tranquillity.</p>

<p>And we have acquired a humility that is, I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
good for us. Well, these are things not readily
expressed—accept our heart-felt thanks.</p>

<p>This is to express our gratitude for your prayers.
They have helped us in our trial—they are helping—and
I know that in part to your efforts Rose
owes her life and we our peace of mind. For fifteen
or sixteen years she will, the doctors say, remain
paralysed, unable to move her arms or legs.
But her mind is active and we will keep her happy.
I think that there are compensations, spiritual and
mental, for the loss of physical power.</p>

<p>My wife and I are studying Catholic doctrine
and we hope to be received this Autumn.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>You may be amused by the circular which I enclose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
You know, we have been having a plague of
white-slave plays in New York this season—“The
Lure,” “The Fight” and the rest; and now they
are giving white-slave moving pictures—“The
Traffic in Souls” they are called. I think that “The
Drama as a Factor in Sex Education” is ridiculous—and
I’m going to say so. Most of the other people
who are to speak at the Academy of Medicine
are very serious-minded settlement workers, ready
to save the world by means of eugenics and inexpensive
divorce. So I don’t think I’ll make myself
very popular. But I hope to have a lot of fun.</p>

<p>My wife and I are very comfortable now that we
are Catholics. I think we rather disappointed
Father Cronyn (the Paulist who received us) by
not showing any emotion during the ceremony.
But our chief sensation is simply comfort—we feel
that we’re where we belong, and it’s a very pleasant
feeling.</p>

<p>I wonder if the enclosed verses will shock you. I
am very much bored by the praise of suicide so common
in “æsthetic” circles. Many of my friends like
to think themselves “decadents” and they are most
enthusiastic over the work of such third-rate versifiers
as the late Richard Middleton, who killed himself
at the age of thirty. It seems to me that suicide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
is the most absurd of all sins. There is, undoubtedly,
pleasure in many sorts of evil; many crimes
are reprehensible but not ridiculous. But suicide is
a stupid sort of sin—the criminal gets no fun at all
out of it. I have tried to put this idea into verse—and
you should have heard the criticisms when the
poem was read aloud at a meeting of the Poetry
Society!</p>

</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>I am grateful to you for your sound criticism of
“To a Young Poet Who Killed Himself.” It had
previously been criticised by “pagans” who thought
that suicide was romantic and charming. You gave
me just what I needed—an analysis of its “philosophy.”
Of course I’ll leave it out of my new book
of verse, or else, as you suggest, make it the utterance
of someone not myself.</p>

<p>You will be glad to hear of our Christmas present
from Soeur Therese. Rose can lift her left forearm.
I know that you have been getting her aid for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
us. Please tell us how to show our gratitude to her
and to you.</p>

<p>A picture of Rose and her mother is going to you

<p class="dear">Dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>At last I have leisure to thank you for your
Christmas gifts. I did not know that such beautiful
cards were made. How is it that in Prairie du
Chien—a place of which the name suggests Indians
and tomahawks and Deadwood stage-coaches—you
can procure better cards than I can get in New
York? The medals are highly valued—the workmanship
on them is admirable—they will be worn
properly as soon as I can afford to buy some silver
chains—and that will be next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Of course you understand my conversion. I am
beginning to understand it. I believed in the Catholic
position, the Catholic view of ethics and æsthetics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
for a long time. But I wanted something not
intellectual, some conviction not mental—in fact I
wanted Faith.</p>

<p>Just off Broadway, on the way from the Hudson
Tube Station to the Times Building, there is a
Church, called the Church of the Holy Innocents.
Since it is in the heart of the Tenderloin, this name
is strangely appropriate—for there surely is need
of youth and innocence. Well, every morning for
months I stopped on my way to the office and
prayed in this Church for faith. When faith did
come, it came, I think, by way of my little paralysed
daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; I think
her tiny still feet know beautiful paths. You
understand this and it gives me a selfish pleasure to
write it down.</p>

<p>I was very glad of your criticism of “The Young
Poet Who Killed Himself.” I need some stricter
discipline, I think, and it’s hard to get it. I enjoy
Father Cullem’s direction very much, he is a
fine old Irishman with no nonsense about him. But
I need to be called a fool, I need to have some of
the conceit and sophistication knocked out of me.
I suppose you think this is “enthusiasm”—that
much heralded danger of converts. Perhaps it is,
but I don’t think so. I know I’m glad I live two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
miles from the Church, because it’s excellent for a
lazy person like myself to be made to exert himself
for religion. And I wish I had a stern mediæval
confessor—the sort of person one reads about in
anti-Catholic books—who would inflict real penances.
The saying of Hail Marys and Our Fathers
is no penance, it’s a delight.</p>

<p>Forgive this egotistical letter! I am praying that
the New Year may bring you much happiness.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father Daly:</p>

<p>If you read my “Some Mischief Still” I hope
the strong language of my janitor didn’t shock you.
I’ve written to my long-suffering confessor to ask
whether or not I can let characters in my plays and
stories “cuss” when they feel so disposed. I fear
that I introduced a new sin to him—vicarious profanity.</p>

<p>You asked me several questions recently. Let
me see if I can answer them. In the first place, you
asked me why I addressed the Holy Name Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
of Suffern, New York. The answer to that is, why
not? I go to Sacred Heart Church in Suffern. My
parish church is in Ramsey, New Jersey, but we
Mahwah Catholics (those of us who go to Church)
are allowed to go to Suffern, which is much nearer.
Ramsey has only a small Mission Church, to which
comes the priest from Hohokus.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I tolerate no levity on the name
<em>Suffern!</em> especially from a dweller in Prairie du
Chien (named after a ridiculous vermin) who has
been visiting a place called Pilsen (named after a
beer) and conducting a retreat in a place called
Peoria (obviously a corruption of Peruna, a patent
medicine of ill repute).</p>

<p>You ask me if I know what a retreat is. I do, because
long before I was a Catholic, before I was a
wild-eyed Socialistic revolutionary, I was a ritualistic
Anglican, and I went twice up to Holy Cross
Monastery at West Park. This is an Anglican institution,
which observes a modification of the Benedictine
rule. And there I learned about imitation
retreats, anyway. I must go to a regular retreat
sometime.</p>

<p>I don’t expect to take any vacation this Summer,
but I’m going to spend several Saturdays fishing.
I hope you do not scorn that wholesome and unliterary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
diversion. Most writers of my acquaintance
consider it lamentably base.</p>

<p>I hope you were satisfied with your efforts at
Peoria. I did what you asked. By the way, when
you pray for the Kilmers, please include a new
Kilmer, who is coming, we hope, in October. He—or
she—will have Barry among his or her names,
after the family from whom my wife is descended.</p>

<p>Your suggestion as to a lecture tour is characteristically
kind. I am already on the books of a lecture
manager named Feakins, who manages Chesterton,
Barry Pain and other people. I’ll probably
lecture before Catholic organizations as well as secular
ones, because I need the money, but I don’t
want to for reasons you will, I know, understand.
In the first place, I don’t want in any way to make
money out of my religion, to seem to be a “professional
Catholic.” In the second place, I have delight
chiefly in talking veiled Catholicism to non-Catholics,
in humbly endeavouring to be an Apostle
to Bohemia. I have no real message to Catholics,
I have Catholicism’s message to modern pagans.
So I want to lecture chiefly to Pagans.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father James:</p>

<p>This is to say that I am rapidly recovering my
health, and hope to be in my office in a week. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
had a fine time in the hospital, a comfortable place
run by particularly amiable Sisters of Charity. It
may interest you to know that I had received the
Blessed Sacrament half an hour before the train
struck me, and that to this fact I attribute my escape
from death—since at the place where I was
struck several men have been killed, being thrown
forward and under the wheels, instead of, (as I
was), to one side.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father James:</p>

<p>Your letter was opened and read by one Private
Kilmer, a hardened military cuss, unused to literary
activities. This is the first literary labor he has essayed
for a month, aside from studying Moss’s
Manual of Military Training and the art of shooting
craps.</p>

<p>We’re still in New York—at the Armory from
9 <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> to 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, but we usually get home at
night. Young Louis is in the same company as myself.
We probably will go to Spartansberg, North
Carolina, about Aug. 17, but we may be here till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
October, or we may go to France to-morrow. Nobody
knows. I find that there are many Catholics
in the Seventh. It’s amusing that our training
camp is in North Carolina—nothing to drink and no
Jesuits! Bishop is a Benedictine mitred abbott—it’s
in Belmont Abbey.</p>

<p>Before mobilisation I finished editing “Dreams
and Images,” an anthology of Catholic verse
written since (but including) Patmore. Terrible
rush job, but pretty good book. Do you mind having
it dedicated to you? Wanted to include some of
your stuff, but didn’t have time to get any. Have
dedicated it to you, but can change it, if you wish.
Don’t hesitate to say so! Can’t hurt my feelings!
Hard military character, seriously considering acquisition
of habit of chewing tobacco.</p>

<p>This is an absurd note, but I find myself very
stupid at writing. Perhaps after drill becomes
easier, I’ll have more of a mind left at night. Fr.
Dwight honoured me by asking me for a sonnet on
St. Ignatius for <i>America</i>, but I fell down on the
assignment. I could not write even a limerick on
St. Ignatius in my present mental state! But it’s a
comfortable life physically—mentally too, I guess,
and as for spiritually, why, pray for yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Fr. James:</p>

<p>I never expected to write to you on lined paper
or Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. paper—uses of adversity! The
Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. gives us poor “dough boys” the only
place we have to sit down and read and write—so
far the Knights of Columbus have not been in evidence
in this highly papistical camp. I am, as you
know, a member of the 165th Infantry, U.&nbsp;S., formerly
the 69th New York. I have recently been
transferred from Co. H. to Headquarters Co., and
exchanged my 8 hours a day of violent physical exercise
(most deadening to the brain, a useful anodyne
for me, coming as it did after my grief) for
exacting but interesting statistical work. I am
called Senior Regimental Statistician, but in spite
of all these syllables still rank as a private. My
work is under the direction of the Regimental
Chaplain, Fr. Francis Patrick Duffy. The people
I like best here are the wild Irish—boys of 18 or 20,
who left Ireland a few years ago, some of them to
escape threatened conscription, and travelled about
the country in gangs, generally working on the railroads.
They have delightful songs that have never
been written down, but sung in vagabonds’ camps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and country jails. I have got some of the songs
down and hope to get more—“The Boston Burglar”—“Sitting
in My Cell All Alone”—they are
fine, a veritable Irish-American folk-lore. Before
I was transferred to Headquarters Co., I slept in a
tent with a number of these entertaining youths,
and enjoyed it tremendously. We sang every night
from 9 to 9.30. Now I am in more sophisticated
but less amusing company—ambitious youths,
young office men, less simple and genial than my
other friends.</p>

<p>I get to New York for part of Saturday and
Sunday. Aline is staying with her mother in New
York. It is good that I am not with the 7th Regiment
in Spartanburg—as it is I can telephone to
Aline every night. I will send you a picture of
Rose soon. Her death was a piercing blow, but
beautiful. It happened at the best time. Aline was
there and I and our parish priest. Rose was happy
but did not want to get well. “I’ll drink it in another
house,” she said, when the nurse coaxed her
to take some broth. Perhaps she meant the new
house in Larchmont which we move to in October.
And perhaps not. There was a Mission in our
parish-church, just a couple of blocks from the
house, and while Rose died the voices of the Sisters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
singing “O Salutaris Hostia” could be heard in the
room. I thank you for your letter, beautifully interpretative.
Certainly Rose makes Heaven dearer to
us.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father James:</p>

<p>I hope you don’t mind being typewritten to by
an unskillful typist. I have learned all I know of
this art since I became a soldier. It is ridiculous for
a newspaperman to learn typewriting in the army,
but I never had the time to learn it before—I found
it better to have an expert typist for a secretary and
dictate my stuff to him. I used to turn out four or
five thousand words an hour when Watts was working
for me. I haven’t much speed as yet but I
ought to be pretty good at it when I get back.
There are two things I always wanted to learn—how
to typewrite and how to serve Mass. I’m
learning the one and I’m going to get Fr. Duffy
to let me pinch-hit for his orderly at Mass some
mornings. So I’ll be an accomplished cuss when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
come back from the Wars—I’ll know how to typewrite
and to serve Mass and to sing the Boston
Burglar.</p>

<p>Numerous philanthropic citizens are sending
cigarettes to soldiers, and pipe-tobacco (in which
last bounty I often share). But some enlightened
person should start a nation-wide campaign for
sending cigars to Senior Regimental Statistical
Representatives. I am Senior Statistical Representative
of the 165th U.&nbsp;S. Infantry, I am!</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Father James:</p>

<p>When I next visit Campion, I will teach you (in
addition to “The Boston Burglar”) an admirable
song called “Down in the Heart of the Gas-House
District.” I sing it beautifully. Its climax is,
“If you would meet good fellows face to face, Just
hang around Jimmy Cunningham’s place, For it’s
down in the heart of the Gas-house district, In Old
New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>I received two most welcome letters from you recently.
One had to do with the case of ——. It
contains excellent advice, and I am carrying it in
my pocket, intending to clip your name and the
name of the college from it and to give it to him.
I am deeply grateful, my dear Father, for your
great and characteristic kindness in this matter. I
think we’ll yet see him practicing and teaching philosophy.
You see, in his veins is a dangerous mixture
of bloods—like my own—German and Irish,
perhaps that accounts for his troubles. Gaelic impetuosity
and Teutonic romanticism—no, sentimentality—no,
self-pity—no, what is it that makes
Germans German? I mean Sturm und Drang,
Sorrows of Werther and that sort of thing. Well,
it doesn’t matter what it’s called. But all people
with any German blood have a bit of it. And
highly diluted it’s rather nice. Which reminds me
that Father Duffy says I’m half German and half
human.</p>

<p>I wrote a poem called “Rouge Bouquet.” I’ll
ask Aline to send you a copy—it’s long—and you
remind her. It will tell you of an incident which
will indicate to you that handling statistics in Regimental
Headquarters isn’t the dry task you imagine
it. The statistics aren’t dry—they’re wet—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
red. Also, I’m attached to the Regimental Intelligence
Section, which is exciting. I had a very
thrilling week not long ago—I’m not allowed to
write about it yet. I’ll tell you about it some day.
By the way, it was at that time—Feb. 26, that you
wrote to me. I wasn’t in the office then, I was out
working as an observer—finest job in the army!
By the way, I’m a Sergeant now. I’ll never be anything
higher. To get a commission I’d have to go
away for three months to a school, and then—whether
or not I was made an officer—I’d be sent
to some outfit other than this. And I don’t want to
leave this crowd. I’d rather be a Sergeant in the
69th than a Lieutenant in any other regiment in the
world. Get Aline to send you a copy of “Holy Ireland”—it
will explain, somewhat.</p>

<p>Please give my love to anybody who will accept
it. Remember me with special fervour to Sister
Eugene and Sister Stanislaus. I enjoy reading the
Campion, and am glad to see the newspaper has become
a reality.</p>

<p>You speak of French anti-clericals in your letter.
They all must be in Paris. I haven’t found any in
my rather extensive wanderings around France.
As a common soldier, I have the privilege of intimacy
with the French peasants—and I find them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
edifyingly good Catholics. Pray for me, dear
Father James.</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Father James:</p>

<p>I am sending you with this letter some verses that
will, I think, interest you. They are my first attempt
at versification in a dug-out—a dug-out not
far from the event of which the verses tell. I have
sent a copy to Aline, but since the trans-Atlantic
mails are so uncertain, will you be so kind as to
write to her asking if she has received it?</p>

<p>Somewhere within a radius of five miles from
where I write now slumbers (for it’s long after bedtime
for soldiers who keep regular hours) one
Drury Sheehan. Every day he meets someone from
my outfit and asks after me and says he’s coming to
see me. And some days ago I—riding on a truck—passed
and was passed several times by his outfit.
And I paged him, so to speak, unavailingly.
Also numerous letters from the States tell me that
young Father Charles O’Donnell is somewhere
near. We’ll have a great reunion one of these days.
I wish you’d be in it! But one of these nights I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
jump off a freight at Prairie du Chien, break a pane
of glass in a basement window and go to sleep in the
Bishop’s room. The Brother will be aghast next
morning at discovering a ragged mustachioed
shaven headed soldier in such a place—I’ll try to
explain to him that I’m an adopted alumnus of
Campion—I’ll probably use French in my excitement—and
he will promptly shoot me. Then I’ll
spend two months in the Campion Infirmary, which
is, I am told, a very nice place.</p>

<p>I am having a delightful time, but it won’t break
my heart for the war to end. I feel much comforted
and strengthened by many prayers—those of my
wife and little children, those of many dear friends,
mostly priests and Sisters. I value highly my share
in your Masses. Always pray hard, my dear
Father, for</p>

</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Mother:</p>

<p>The sweater arrived, and it certainly is a magnificent
specimen of knitting, and the wristlets are
wonderfully purled—whatever purling may be.
Probably I shall need both sweater and wristlets for
many weeks, for although it is Spring now, it often
is cold.</p>

<p>Under separate cover I am sending you my warrant
as Sergeant. I thought you might like to have
it framed to hang in the Old-Fashioned Room.
The “drafted” in the corner means that the regiment
was drafted into Federal Service; that is,
made a part of the United States Army instead of
a part of the New York State National Guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>I suppose that you have read in the newspapers
of the Regiment’s recent activities. Now we are
taking it easy in a very pleasant little town. I hope
we may stay here at least a month, as it is hard to
work when the Regiment is moving about the country.
I had a week’s respite from office work some
time ago and spent it doing what is called “observation”
work for the Regimental Intelligence Section.
It was most interesting.</p>

<p>Did Aline tell you of Kenton’s success in school?
It seems that he won a gold medal for being the best
pupil in the school. I was delighted to learn it. So
nearly as I can remember, I was not an especially
keen student when I was his age, although I became
one later.</p>

<p>There is practically no chance of my rising any
higher in the Regiment than Sergeant, and I am
perfectly content. To become an officer I would
have to go to school away from the Regiment for
several months, then if I failed to pass my examinations
and win a commission, I would be sent to some
other Regiment than this, and if I succeeded I would
be sent as an officer, not back to the 69th, but to some
other outfit, and I want very much to stay with the
Regiment. I have many good friends here, and I
would feel lost in any other military organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>I am looking forward to receiving the photographs
you have had taken. By this time you must
have received the one I sent you. I hope you like it.</p>

<p>Your letters are very gratefully received, and I
am looking forward specially to receiving the cake
and the candy you sent me. Everything else you
have written of in your letters has arrived in good
condition, and a day or two ago I got five big jars of
excellent tobacco from the Dickens Fellowship
... a most intelligent gift.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Mother:</p>

<p>As to your “War Mother” poem, I hesitate to
tell you how much I like it, because I am afraid you
may think I am trying to flatter you. It certainly
is the best poem you ever wrote—beautiful, original
and well sustained. I have seen no recent war verse
I like so well. There is no question but what you
will sell it to some good magazine. I certainly congratulate
you, and congratulate the magazine fortunate
enough to print your poem.</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear of the deserved success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
your songs made at Lakewood, and in general of
your triumphs at the Dickens Fellowship, and elsewhere.
I wish I could have witnessed them, but I
will be seeing more of the same sort next winter.
That is what we like to hear about over here—triumphs
and celebrations, and in general the pleasant
and prosperous course of civilian life.</p>

<p>Of course we soldiers are undergoing hardships
and privations—we expect to, but we don’t spend
our time advertising them. But in the States when
you find they must do without quite as much wheat,
or meat, or something of the sort, instead of just
going without and keeping their mouths shut, they
advertise their remarkable abstention by having
“wheatless days” and “meatless days,” and all that
sort of hysterical rubbish, and fill the papers with
the news, thereby disgusting us soldiers and undoubtedly
comforting the enemy. I think I will
start a “strawberryless, ice creamless, sodaless day”
for the army. It would be as sensible as what the
people at home have been doing. If you (I don’t
mean you personally, of course) have to eat hardtack
instead of butter-raised biscuits, why eat the
hardtack and shut up about it, but don’t be such an
ass as to have a “butter-raised biscuitless Monday,”
and don’t shut down on theatres and amusements;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
and don’t deprive people of their honest drink.
Merely making stay-at-homes dismal does not help
the soldiers a bit. England’s early “Business as
Usual” scheme was more practicable, and this is
something of a concession for me to make. There
is quite a sermon on economics for you! Kindly
read it to my father, whom it will edify and instruct.
A recent letter from him shows that he utterly misunderstands
my point of view on this subject, the
result of lamentably careless reading by him of one
of my letters in which I contrasted the gaiety and
common-sense of the French, through years of starvation
and ruin, with the wail which a little self-denial
brought from the States.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Mother,</p>

<p>I presume by this time you have received the
humorous photographs of myself I sent you.</p>

<p>I am delighted to know of the Kilburn Hall project.
By all means buy the Hall; it will be an excellent
investment. Property is now very cheap in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
England, and prices will rise as soon as the war is
over. I hope to be able to spend my summers in
France after the war, and I have the place in mind—only
about a day’s run from London. I am absolutely
in love with France, its people, its villages, its
mountains, everything about it. America would
do well to copy its attitude in the war. It has suffered
tremendous hardships with dignity and
humour and kept its sanity and faith. America,
to judge by the papers, grows hysterical over a little
self-denial; can’t do without an extra lump of sugar
in its tea without a band and speeches and “sugarless”
Sundays. It is funny and rather pathetic to us
soldiers. But I honestly think, although it may
seem conceited to say so, that when we soldiers get
back from the war we will do the spiritual and
intellectual life of the States a lot of good. France
has taught us lessons of infinite value.</p>

<p>I am having an absolutely Heavenly time since I
joined the Intelligence Section. I wouldn’t change
places with any soldier of any rank in any outfit.
This suits me better than any job I ever had in civil
life.</p>

<p>The cake is not yet here. I will soak it in wine
all right, don’t worry about that. Speaking of
wine, enclosed find some flowers given me by a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
nice wine-shop girl in a city near here. “Madelon”
is a perfectly respectable song, but “Madelon” is
not a gun or anything else of the sort; it is the name
of the girl who serves wine to the soldiers, as the
song clearly states.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Mother:</p>

<p>There is a chance that I will be able to get to
England on a seven days’ leave in a few weeks. In
that case I shall probably spend most of my time in
London, with a possible visit to Oxfordshire, where
my friend Mrs. Denis Eden lives. I wish there was
something I could do for you to expedite the purchase
of Kilburn Hall, but since the Archbishop of
Yorkshire is in the States you should, yourself, be
able to make a deal with him. English real estate is
a wise investment these days; it will go up fifty
per cent in a year’s time. I wish I could afford to
buy some property in this country. I certainly
would like to live here. If the States go “dry” I
honestly think I will move my family over here. I
can write for American papers without living in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
America. Then if you move to Kilburn Hall I will
be only a day’s trip away from you, and you will
love rural France almost as much as you love rural
England.</p>

</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Mother:</p>

<p>I received three letters from you yesterday and
to-day, the first I have had from you in a long time.
Your letters always come in bunches like that. And
this morning I received two admirable boxes of
Mirror Candy, in perfect condition. I certainly
was delighted to get it, as it is a long time since I
have had any candy. My gratitude is so great that
I even will refer to it as “Sweets.”</p>

<p>I was also glad to get your picture, taken on shipboard.
You must send to Larchmont another copy
of the picture of yourself looking at my photograph,
which you sent me some weeks ago, as I had to remove
it from its mount and cut it down to make it
fit into my wallet. All the rest of the fellows in the
Intelligence Section (there are nine of us, nearly all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
college graduates, and men of some standing—editors,
brokers, etc.), have pictures of their mothers,
but none of them so good looking as mine.</p>

<p>You would be amused at some of the scenes when
your picture is exhibited. Tired from a long hike
from a stay in the trenches, I am having an omelet,
and some fried potatoes, and some vin rouge, beau
coup, le vin rouge in some French peasant’s little
kitchen. It is a cottage such as you and I often
visited in Derbyshire and Cambridgeshire; a low
grey stone building with rose trees against the wall,
a tiny garden, and a geometrically neat path. The
kitchen floor is of stone, the table without a cloth,
but shining from much polishing. The only thing
to distinguish it from the typical English rural cottage
is the crucifix on the wall, and the wooden
shoes at the door. (People wear sabots out of
doors, cloth slippers in the house, leather shoes on
Sunday). Well, after such a repast as I have described,
I take out my wallet to pay my bill, and the
sharp eyes of little Marie, or little Pierre, intently
watching this strange soldat Americaine espy the
picture. At once an inquisitive, but delighted, infant
is on my knee demanding a closer inspection
of the picture; the Maman must see it, and Grandpere,
and Veuve Vatre from across the street (the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
man of the house can’t see it; he is away from home
on the errand that brought me across the sea).
Well, they all say “Elle est jolie, ma foi, et jeune
aussi.” These comments have been made on your
picture many times in many towns, which I will one
day show you on a map of France.</p>

<p>I have not much anxiety for my father, for I look
on his condition as a state of rest really necessary to
a mind so constantly busy. But I am glad that
from you I have inherited the power of readily escaping
from worry and work; of entering with enthusiasm
into whatever mirth I find around me; in
finding good and true and merry friends everywhere.
I think that some of this quality would have
helped my father very much, and increased his
bodily and mental health. I worried grievously
about you for a while, and wished I could have
been with you when my father was taken ill, but I
don’t worry now—you are too spirited and courageous
for anybody to worry about. I certainly
admire you more than ever, and look forward
eagerly to regular banquets at Henri’s and Rector’s
with you.</p>

<p>I want you to meet all the Regimental Intelligence
Section—a fine bunch of brave men, and good
comrades. We have taken big chances together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
and it has made us the best of friends. You will
like them all and they will like you.</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Kenton:</p>

<p>I hope that by this time you have entirely recovered
from your illness. I remember that I had
whooping-cough when I was about your age. If
you are back in school, send me some of your
monthly reports. The address you must put on letters
to me is just what you see at the top of this
sheet, except that you must put before it “Private
Joyce Kilmer.”</p>

<p>There is a school in the building where I work,
much like the school you attend, except that there
are no nuns here for teachers. When the weather is
wet, the children wear wooden shoes instead of rubbers.
They go to school at eight in the morning and
don’t leave until five. You wouldn’t like that,
would you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

I will later. And I know that your mother and all
your grandparents will give you things, and so will
Saint Nicholas.</p>

<p>Be a good boy, and pray to St. Francis and Our
Lady to help you. You ought to go to Mass every
morning, since you live so near the church. Take

<p>Your plan for ending the war is very good. I

in the Spanish-American war, long before you were
born, and he said that your plan was the one that the
American Army would adopt.</p>

<p>I am glad to see that you can write and typewrite
so well. I hope that you will get Fr. Morris to teach
you how to serve Mass, we live so near the church
that you can easily serve his Mass and get your
breakfast and get to school on time, and if you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>

If you didn’t get it, let me know and I’ll send you

<p>Yesterday morning about six o’clock I climbed
down the mountain to go to Mass. And just outside
the village where the church is, I met a young
lady and walking beside her was a pleasant young
pig with a pink nose.</p>

<p>This is what is technically known as a hurried
scrawl. It is to the effect that I have arrived, in
excellent health and spirits. I have recently read
the Censorship Regulations, and am in doubt about
what I can say—God help the people who have to
interpret them! I mailed a postcard two weeks
ago, which you should now receive. Also I’ll try to
cable you soon, if it is allowed. I have not yet consulted
the adjutant on the subject, but so far as I
have been able to find from a diligent study of the
censorship regulations, I am allowed to say that I
love you. Accordingly, I state it, with considerable
enthusiasm. Also, I have a certain regard for Kenton,
Deborah, Michael and even Christopher. I
hope to write you again very soon. You know my
address—same as before, only American Expeditionary
Forces. I enclose some verses which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
entertain you. The brief one is a memory of the
days when I used to drill. I don’t feel that way
about a typewriter—which instrument I now use
with accuracy and speed. Send me some magazines
now and then, and <i>Times</i> <span class="smcap">Review of Books</span>. And
love me exceedingly.</p>

<p>I am having a delightful time out here—absolutely
beautiful country and very nice people. I
am short of money, but I believe we’ll be paid soon
and I’ve borrowed 80 francs from Fr. Duffy. That
isn’t as much as it sounds—you get 5 francs and 70
centimes for a dollar at the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. I enclose
a bill I received for two enormous boxes of cakes I
hired an old lady to make for me. I furnished the
sugar—you know there was a bag of it in the box of
groceries my mother sent me just before I left. I
meant the cakes for dessert for Thanksgiving
dinner, but with the help of my friends I’ve already
eaten most of it. There is a rumour to the effect
that we are to have duck for dinner to-morrow, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the Regiment is much more excited about it than
about the good news of the War in yesterday’s
paper. We get the Paris editions of the London
<i>Daily Mail</i>, New York <i>Herald</i> and Chicago <i>Tribune</i>,
and before long I suppose we’ll see the magazines
when the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. opens up its local tent.
I never thought I’d regard the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. with
such esteem—I wish the Knights of Columbus had
a chance to do as much work for us.</p>

<p>I haven’t written anything in prose or verse since
I got here—except statistics—but I’ve stored up a
lot of memories to turn into copy when I get a
chance. The Colonel occasionally speaks of my historical
work, but I doubt if it will be feasible to
publish any part of it except some very general
stuff until the war is over. I asked Thomas Hughes
Kelley to send me a history of the 69th published
some years ago, and another copy to you, to make
sure. I think it will be useful in preparing the introductory
chapters.</p>

<p>I was delighted to receive the other day (December
7th, the day after my birthday) a batch of
letters, including two from you. I am glad Kenton
is getting along well; I was worried about his illness.
It is fortunate you were able to get a good nurse.</p>

<p>You ought to be receiving some money from the
government soon. I made over half my pay to you,
and the government is supposed to add to it so much
for you and so much for each youngster. The whole
thing will come to about $57 a month, I believe! I
personally am not in need of money—I am getting
a book of traveller’s cheques from my father and
before I heard he was sending it I wrote to John
Timpson Co., and asked them to open an account
for me in some Paris bank. Also we are paid in
francs, which makes us feel wealthy, as there are
5.70 of them in a dollar. And I could live comfortably
without any spending money—all there is to
buy is candy and canned stuff and wine and an occasional
meal when the business of my department
takes me to a nearby town.</p>

<p>Fr. Garesché’s poem certainly is beautiful; by far
the best thing he has done. I am enclosing a letter
from Sister —— which I think you will enjoy.
Delightful old person, nearly blind, but tremendously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
energetic. Harriet Monroe was one of her
pupils. Probably you remember her book on Fr.
Tabb.</p>

<p>Your Christmas presents probably will reach you
in time for Easter. I hope to get a pair of wooden
shoes for Deborah.</p>

<p>I am having a fine time. My statistical work
occupies me in the evening as well as all day, but it’s
interesting, and will be increasingly important,
since the Statistical Department really is the only
link between the soldier and his family.</p>

<p>I hope as soon as we get settled I’ll be able to do
some writing, I’ve been too busy so far. I love you
very much, and always think of you.</p>

<p>In your letters you spoke of sending me some
stuff. Send anything you think of as soon as you
think of it—don’t wait to find out if I want it, because
the mails take too long. Just now I want
snap-shots of you and the children, especially Deborah,
and tobacco. I love you.</p>

<p>I hope you are getting the letters I send you from
time to time. I got one admirable batch of letters
from you by way of birthday present—they came on
the day after my birthday. Perhaps I’ll get another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
batch for Christmas—it’s December 17th now,
and we should receive another mail soon. I hope to
send you a photograph soon. I believe personal
pictures may be sent through the mail. It will be a
beautiful sight. I got a Sing Sing haircut recently
and am growing a corsair moustache. This is the
pleasantest war I ever attended—nothing to do but
fall in, fall out, pound a typewriter 13 hours a day
and occasionally hike across France and back carrying
a piano. However, I do really enjoy it, and the
work is different in kind from newspaper work, and
so a rest from it. By the way, I sent you some time
ago a poem called “<cite>Militis Meditatio</cite>.” Please send
a copy of it to a magazine and tell them to send the
check for it to you. I hope to be able to do some
writing as soon as we get settled and I get some of
my statistical work out of the way. You ought to
get your allotment this month, with additions from
the Government (I hope you and the children are
not yet in the poorhouse, or at any rate that you
have struck a comfortable poorhouse). Send me
pictures of yourself and the children, especially
Deborah. I have made a nuisance of myself telling
my bored friends about her intelligence in naming
her doll “Hugh and Mrs. Leamy.” Also send me
some tobacco, enough to fill a bedsack (also love me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
as intensely as possible; I love you more than ever
before and think of you all the while)....</p>

Christmas Eve.
</p>

<p>The enclosed clippings may amuse you—after
you read them you’d better send them to Bob Holliday.
They came with a raft of letters a couple of
days ago. It’s very nice the way feasts seem to be
marked—I last heard from you just before my
birthday, and I got three letters from you by way
of Christmas present. There must be a lot of parcels
awaiting me, judging from information in your
letters and those of my father and mother. We
may get the packages to-night, in which case I’ll
have some hours hard work, for all the Adjutant’s
office helps in assorting mail. But I don’t think the
packages will come until after Christmas. I suppose
that you and the children are in New Brunswick
now, and will go to Midnight Mass at St.
Peter’s and pray for a vagrant verse-maker who is
trying to be a soldier. We may have a Midnight
Mass in the church here to-night. Fr. Duffy has
had a choir practising for it, and we possess a tenor
soloist. He is an Italian, a barber when not singing
or soldiering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>I have allotted half my pay to you, and the Government’s
addition to that will bring it, I believe, up
to about $60—enough to pay the rent. But don’t
worry if there is delay in receiving it. It takes a
long time, usually, to set things like that in motion.
I recently read that a veteran of the Civil War had
just received a check for $12 from Washington,
representing his pay for his last month of service.</p>

<p>I am glad you are sending me some tobacco—I
suppose it’s in the five truck loads of Christmas
packages said to be awaiting us at a town some miles
away. I have been able to get American tobacco,
I am glad to say, but not my favourite brand. Also
I’ll be glad to get the cigars my father has sent me—I
have smoked all of Fr. Duffy’s. But be sure
that tobacco or anything else you send me, such as
Michael and Deborah, is very securely wrapped
and tied, as the journey is hard on packages and
many of them go to pieces.</p>

<p>I am hoping to get more letters from you soon—write
as often as you can. I’d rather get a letter
from you than anything else now possible. (I love
you more than ever before).</p>

<p>Virginia is an excellent State. One evening last
week I met by chance a Sergeant Interpreter named
Nicholson Barney Adams. And he didn’t know
my name and I didn’t know his—he is not connected
with the 69th. And he said, “I see by the <i>Times</i>
that Joyce Kilmer has enlisted.” And furthermore,
thereafter, he put me up in his place—he and two
other fellows have a room together—and I had admirable
things to eat and drink, and slept in a bed,
for the first time in over three months. And he
came from Lynchburg, Virginia.</p>

<p>You will find with this letter $50 in American
Express checks. Put the place and date in the
upper right-hand corner when you cash them. You
see, I had written to John Timpson for some money
before I got a book of checks from my father, so I
find myself having more money than I need.</p>

<p>I wrote this letter—the first part of it—this afternoon.
Now it is evening, and five ambulance-loads
of mail have arrived and I have helped distribute it.
I got a November <i>Harpers</i> from my father and a
copy of Frances Huard’s “My Home In the Field
of Mercy” from Doran. To-morrow we get 14
more ambulance loads, they say—I hope I get some
packages, but I especially desire letters from you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
My last letter from you—dated Dec. 12—contained
a very noble poem by you—“High Heart.” I was
delighted to get it, I felt admitted to a realer intimacy
than I had known since I crossed the ocean.
Please send me all your poems, sad or spirited. I
cannot write verse, but enjoy reading it more than
ever before. And you happen to be my favourite
poet.</p>

<p>I bought a copy of Conan Doyle’s new “Sherlock
Holmes” book in a nearby town recently, in the
Conrad edition. A French publisher named Conrad
has taken over the Tauchnitz business—you remember
the Tauchnitz books, don’t you? Also I’ve been
reading Harry Leon Wilson’s, “The Spenders”—an
entertaining imitation of Mr. Howells, and rereading
“The Cardinal’s Snuff Box”—most delightful.</p>

<p>I love you very much, and I am very sorry for
you—you aren’t having the amusing adventures I
am having—but you’re able to write nice things, and
that’s a consolation. I hope to see you and your
admirable babies soon.</p>

<p>Two or three days ago I received from you an
admirable letter, dated December 12, and yesterday
arrived our long errant Christmas mail—many
trucks of it—and in it several letters from you dated
about Thanksgiving. It is strange that my letters
take so long to reach you, but you must have
some of them by now. I certainly was glad to get
ten cans of tobacco from you, I have wanted a pipe
full of that excellent tobacco for months. I got a
thousand stogies from Fr. Daly, a box of cigars
from my father, another from John B. Kennedy
and another from one Romaine Pierson, one of my
father’s friends, who sent me also a large can of
tobacco. Also I got a lot of jelly and candy from
my mother and a little book of “Maxims of Fr.
Faber” from Eleanor Rogers Cox, and enough
scapulars to sink a ship.</p>

<p>It certainly gives me the keenest delight to read
your poetry. The poem about the Christmas Tree
has —— backed off the map. Also “High Heart”
is very noble poetry. I envy you your power of
writing poetry—I haven’t been able to write a thing
since I left the ship. Also I envy you your power
of being high hearted and, wholly legitimately,
aware of your own high heartedness. Not that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
am low spirited—I am merely busy and well-fed
and contented. I am interested but not excited, and
excitement is supposed to be one of war’s few
charms. The contentedness is not absolute, of
course, for I have, when away from you, always a
consciousness of incompleteness. But I have not
had the painful and dangerous times I expected to
find as soon as we reached this country.</p>

<p>I am keenly interested in the novel you and Margaret
are writing. But don’t plunge too deep into
occult studies in getting dope for it. Don’t attend
any seance of any kind or use Planchette or try
automatic writing or make any experiments of a
supernatural kind. If you do, I swear that if I do
get shot I won’t haunt you—and I’m conceited
enough to think I can’t make a worse threat.</p>

<p>By the way, Kenton’s suggestion that you send
me a checkerboard is excellent. I’d like it very
much.</p>

<p>I am enclosing a letter from Helen Parry Eden
which should be put in the autograph-letter file.
A good way to keep author’s letters is to paste special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
envelopes for them on the inside of the covers of
author’s books. Do not use the original envelopes
for this purpose. But probably this plan is unsafe
in a library frequented by wild babies. But at any
rate try to get the stuff stowed away safely and
neatly. Bob Holliday could advise you intelligently
as to the proper preservation of autographed
letters.</p>

<p>It is about a week now since I heard from you,
and I am eagerly awaiting to-day’s arrival of mail.
I work in the place to which the mail is brought for
assortment, so I get my letters without much delay—that
is, delay after they reach the Regiment. The
first delayed batches of mail are still arriving—I get
a November letter one day, a January letter the
next, a December the next.</p>

<p>Send me by all means all the verse you write—I
find I enjoy poetry more these days than I did when
I made my living largely by making it and writing
and talking about it. But I wish I could make it
as I used to—I have not been able to write any verse
at all except “<i>Militis Meditatio</i>” which I sent you.
I wrote a brief prose sketch which is still in process
of censuring—the censorship regulations may or
may not be so interpreted as to exclude it. I think
I’ll be allowed to print it, however, as it is really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
not a writing on military subjects, but an introspective
essay written by a sort of soldier. If it
gets by, it will go immediately to George H. Doran
to be censored.</p>

<p>The second package of tobacco has arrived. The
package containing it was broken, but in the bottom
of the mail bag I found all ten cans of tobacco. I
certainly am glad to get it—after ten years this kind
still seems to me to be the best tobacco in the world.</p>

<p>I am not especially delighted with the circumstances
of my work just at present. I am perfectly
comfortable, have good meals and quarters and my
work is not at all hard. But I want to get into more
interesting and important work—perhaps it will be
all fixed up by the time I write to you again. I
love you.</p>

<p class="dear">My dear Aline:</p>

<p>It is a long time since I have heard from you—about
three weeks. But I suppose that I will receive
a number of letters at once. I do not yet know
whether or not you have received the two batches
of American Express Company checks, amounting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
in all to $100.00, which I sent you some time ago.
But I am not worrying about it, if the checks are
lost it still is possible to recover the money. I sent
you two lots of prose and verse recently, and in the
envelope containing this letter is a quaint supplement
to one of my little sketches—that called
“Breakfasts.” It is a letter to Kenton from the
little girl who lives in the house by the Fountain,
where Farrell and Driscoll and I used to eat every
morning in our last station. I showed Solange (an
excellent, demure and pious infant) Kenton’s
photograph, and told her that he studied French in
school. He is supposed to answer in French, tell
him—of course his French teacher must help him.
I saved the censor trouble by clipping from Solange’s
letter the name of the town honoured by her
presence, but I guarantee (with St. Anthony’s aid)
the safe delivery to her of any epistle he may entrust
to me.</p>

<p>The town we are in now has no Solange—or has
revealed none to me as yet—but in a certain Cafe
which I much frequent is Antoine, aged two, who
can salute in the French manner, <i lang="fr">comme ca</i> (illustrated)
or in the American manner, <i lang="fr">comme ca</i>,
(illustrated). No, not with the left hand! good
Heavens, child! <i lang="fr">Sacre bleu! nom d’um nom!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Quelle dommage!</i> Well, if you are going to cry
about it, you needn’t salute at all. Here, shut up
and drink the dregs of my <i lang="fr">vin rouge et sirop</i>. <i lang="fr">Fini,
bebe!</i></p>

<p>Also there is an admirable child named Jean who
has six months. He wears a lavender cloak with a
hood attached. His home is a barber shop, the most
beautiful and extraordinary barber shop in the
world. His father the barber has gone to the Wars—remain
madame, grandpere, and M. Biebe. It is
a very modern barber shop, with mirror-walls, and
powdered soap in silver salt cellars. Grandpere
sits by the stove all day long and says that there are
many American soldiers in the town. Madame exhibits
le petit Jean and asks if it is ever as cold as
this in America. I shave with six razors if I desire,
and wash in <i lang="fr">beaucoup de l’eau chaud</i>. And Madame
deftly swinging le petit Jean over her left
shoulder opens a secret drawer under a mirror and
proffers me a tiny tube of <em>fixative</em> for my moustache.</p>

<p>I have a delightful delusion now and then—I see
you walk into the Adjutant’s office, past the Sergeant
Major’s desk, and to me. The building in
which we work was once a palace—but its inlaid
floor never supported a duchess (gold powdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
though her hair were, and light her laughter as
champagne bubbles) so precious as this fleeting
vision of you.</p>

home this Summer. If I do come home, I’ll

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>I receive your letters frequently and regularly,
and they are delightful, stimulating, typical. To-day
I returned from a week’s sojourn in a charming
hospital (a strained muscle, now healed, sent me
there) and I found two letters from you awaiting
me, the latest dated February 12. Let me congratulate
you on your aviation poem—most beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
and true, the most intellectual poem you have made.
By all means put it in your book.</p>

<p>I received Francis Carlin’s wholly heavenly book
just before I went to the hospital, and have read it
many times with delight. When you see him, give
him my homage. He should be walking goldener
floors than those of a mortal shop—he should rather
be over here with us, whatever his convictions may
be. For it is wrong for a poet—especially a Gael—to
be listening to elevated trains when there are
screaming shells to hear, and to be sleeping soft in a
bed when there’s a cot in a dug-out awaiting him,
and the bright face of danger to dream about, and
see.</p>

<p>I treasure your picture, and Christopher’s shadowy
profile—send me more photographs. Love
me constantly, never let a day pass without going to
church for me.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>I enclose some verses that you may like very
much. That is, I think I enclose them—I have yet
to consult with our Regimental censor as to whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
or not I may send them. If the place name is cut
out, put in its stead any French proper name that
rhymes and do with the poem as you will. Perhaps
the best thing to do with it will be to hand it to Bob
for publishing.</p>

<p>As to my book—why don’t worry about it—we
all will live just as long and just as happily and
probably be just as wealthy—or poor—if it is never
written. I am cheerfully neglecting it, for many
reasons. One is, of course, the censorship, which
prevents the sending out of articles sufficiently topical
and specific to be interesting. Another is a
military regulation which forbids an officer or enlisted
man from acting as a correspondent or writing
for publication on a military subject. This will
not, I suppose, prevent the publication of such of
my verses and essays as are inspired by my experiences.
But it will prevent my making for serial
publication any consecutive record of events. What
I will do will be to assemble, after the war is over,
or after I have returned from it, such random essays
or rhymes as I have made and bind them together
with a thread of reminiscence—partly introspective,
partly—what is the word? extraspective? external,
at any rate. I shall write nothing that has
any news value. I believe in my vanity that it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
be a most charming book, not without its high lights
of something more than charm. It really is the sort
of book I’d like greatly to read, and I think that it
will reach a public tired of the many war-narratives.
And don’t think people won’t read it after the war
is over! They will! The only sort of book I care to
write about the war is the sort people will read after
the war is over—a century after it is over! And
that is the sort of book I am going to make. A
<i lang="fr">journal intime</i>, but as close to literature, as carefully
thought and wrought as I can do. It will be
episodic—chaotic, perhaps—no glib tale, no newspaper
man’s work—but with God’s help, a work of
art. So clamour not for copy! My enclosures of
some weeks ago may have pleased you, but you’ll
like this better.</p>

<p>Which for no reason brings me to the subject of
growing middle-aged, an experience which you are
enjoying, I trust; I know I enjoy it. What an advantage
we have over our children! While they, to
their embarrassment, grow up—voices changing,
legs and arms becoming too obvious, self-consciousness
and shallow romanticism seizing them—we
gracefully, comfortably, grow down. Perhaps it is
as a protective measure that I, a private soldier,
grow vain—as snails develop shells—but I confess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
it is with consummate pleasure that I contemplate
my senility and, may I say, mediævality. I picture
myself at forty, rotund but eminently presentable,
moustache and hair delicately grayed, tailored
admirably, with the leisurely power no young man
may have. I picture myself at sixty, with a long
white moustache, a pale gray tweed suit, a very
large Panama hat. I can see my gnarled but beautifully
groomed hands as they tremblingly pour out
the glass of dry sherry which belongs to every old
man’s breakfast. I cannot think of myself at seventy
or eighty—I grow hysterical with applause—I
am lost in a delirium of massive ebony canes,
golden snuff-boxes, and daily silk hats.</p>

<p>And as for you! My God! what a vision! That
dear autumnal hair silvering—the mouth of my delight
exquisitely etched with honourable lines—each
one the record of a year’s love—those eyes richer in
their mystery—but I cannot write of this—for the
thought might give me power to sweep away the
years and make me find you, when I come back from
the Wars, becapped and tremulous and leaning on
two sticks! NO! I don’t want you to be old now—I
want you to be the innocent sophisticated young
woman you are in the little picture I carry (traditionally!)
over my heart. But I want to watch you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
grow old—if I can watch you and at the same time
hold you in my arms.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>This letter is written to you from a real town—written,
in fact, above ground. You may be surprised
to know that recent letters to you were not
written in these conditions. They were written in a
dug-out, but I was not permitted to tell you so at
the time. In a dug-out, also, were written the
verses I sent you some two weeks ago—you may remember
their damp-clayey flavour. I slept and
worked (the latter sometimes for twenty hours at
a time) in this dug-out for a month, except for one
week when I was out on special work with the Regimental
Intelligence Section. You don’t begrudge
me that week, do you? I cannot now describe it,
but it was a week of wonder—of sights and sounds
essential, I think, to my experience. For there are
obligations of experience—or experiences of obligation—to
be distinguished from what I might call experiences
of supererogation or experiences of perfection—but
what rubbish this is! Let us rather consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
my present great luxury, and the marvels of
which it is composed. In the first place, one room
(not a cot in a crowded barrack, not a coffin-like
berth in a subterranean chamber) but a real room,
with windows and a large bed and a table and chairs
and a practical wash stand. The bed I share with
one L—— D——, an amiable gamin, about to be
made a Corporal. I am a Sergeant—with stripes
some five days old. (It is the height of my ambition,
for to be commissioned I’d be sent to school for
three months and then, whether or not I succeeded,
be assigned to another Regiment. And I’d rather
be a Sergeant in the 69th than lieutenant in any
other outfit.)</p>

<p>To continue—I also eat from a table excellent
meals, with a napkin on my knees. I have soldiered
pretty hard for some months now, taking everything
as it came, and I think I’ve honestly earned
my stripes. Now I’m going to have an easier life—not
working less hard, but not seeking hardships.
So I am paying seven francs a day for meals, and
six francs a week for my share in a bed-room. And
it’s delightfully refreshing. Also, I yesterday had a
hot shower-bath—very much a novelty!</p>

<p>This morning I received two letters from you, to
my great joy. The pictures of the children are excellent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
I am glad to see Deborah’s hair so long
and lovely. Do, by all means, send me pictures of
yourself and Deborah in a leather case, as you
promise. I can imagine no possible gift I’d rather
receive. Mail is coming here every day now, so I
look forward to frequent messages from you.</p>

<p>What a cheerless place the States must be these
days! Don’t send me American papers (except the
<i>Times Book Review</i>) for they depress me, showing
me what a dismal land you live in. This meatless,
wheatless day business is very wearying. It can
do no earthly good—it is merely giving comfort to
the enemy, who undoubtedly know all about it. I
wish—aside from the obvious greatest reasons—that
you were here in France—you’d like everything,
but especially the gentle, kind, jovial, deeply
pious people. Time enough—to resume—for
wheatless days when the enemy takes your wheat.
Until then, carpe diem!—that is, eat buckwheat
cakes with plenty of syrup.</p>

<p>I am disgusted with all I read in the American
Magazines about the Americans in France. It is
all so hysterical and all so untrue. It isn’t jealousy
that makes me say this—I have no desire to compete
with newspaper-correspondents—but it annoys me
to see the army to which I belong and the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
on and for whose soil we are fighting so stupidly
misrepresented.</p>

<p>I hope you received “Rouge Bouquet”—if you
did receive it I know you liked it. General ——
(I forgot, I mustn’t name generals lower in rank
than Major-Generals) had twelve copies of it made.
I sent it to you two weeks ago—you should be receiving
it now. The newspapers by now have re-revealed
its meaning to you, if any explanation was
needed. It was read at an evening entertainment at
one of our camps at the front. Father Duffy read
it, and taps was played on the cornet before and
after. I couldn’t get down to hear it—I was
further front, at work in the dug-out that night.</p>

<p>I think most of my war book will be in verse. I
prefer to write verse, and I can say in verse things
not permitted to me in prose. You remember—no,
probably you don’t—Coventry Patmore and his
confessor. The confessor objected to the passionate
explicitness of some of Coventry’s devotional
poems—they dealt with things esoteric, he said, and
should be set forth in Latin, not in the profane
tongue. And Coventry replied that for most people
poetry was an incomprehensible language, more
hidden than Latin—or more hiding.</p>

<p>And speaking of Coventry Patmore, the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
way to fry potatoes is to have deep oil or butter violently
boiling in a great pot, to slip the slices of
potatoes into it and stir them persistently, never
letting them touch the pot’s bottom, to lift them out
(when they are golden brown) by means of a small
sieve, and to place them on paper so that the grease
may be absorbed.</p>

<p>The best news I’ve had since I reached France is
about Kenton’s medal. I’m going to write to-day
and tell him so.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>My chief occupation at the present time is awaiting
a letter from you.</p>

<p>It is several hours since I wrote the first paragraph
of this letter. I have been to supper (I am
hitting the mess-line these days, for my money gave
out and I didn’t want to borrow any more) and
ridden in a motor-cycle-side car all over the countryside—through
a dozen little villages, every one
full of French and American soldiers, with a sprinkling
of coolie labourers, in quest of a certain village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
which holds two companies of a certain outfit with
which I had to have a conference. The village was
hard to find (their names all sound alike, and old
French ladies, when interrogated as to direction, always
point in a direction in which there is no road
and say something that sounds like “Honk! honk!
Ba! ba!”) and also the night was cold. I have enjoyed
many rides more. Returning to the office (I
sleep in the same building) half frozen and weary, I
found that not two truck-loads, but two sacks of letters
had been delivered, and that I had received
three letters. I leaped at the letters—one was an invitation
to a Ladies’ Day at the Columbia University
Club, another was from my mother, another
from Fr. Garesché. None from You! You accused
me in one of your letters of writing to you
when I was depressed—well, I’m depressed now, all
right! I’ll wait until to-morrow morning to finish
this letter, I guess, or else I’ll give you real cause
for complaint. Not that I blame you, or think
you haven’t written often—it’s the mail system’s
fault. Good night!</p>

<p>I hope Kenton has learned to serve Mass by this
time. I wrote to him a long time ago and told him
to see Fr. Morris about it, but I fear that he would
be too shy to do this unless some pressure were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
brought to bear. If you would ask Fr. Morris to
teach him how to serve Mass, and persuade him to
ask Kenton to come to see him about it, so that the
initiative would seem to come from Fr. Morris, I
think things would work out well. I pray for Kenton
to have the grace of a vocation to the priesthood—I
hope he may have a Jesuit vocation—and I
think it is good to do all we can toward the fulfillment
of this desire—this is, I think, a supplementary
way to “sway the designs of God.” I think of
the children often and can visualise them well in
spite of my long absence from them, that is, all except
young Christopher. I am aware of Kenton’s
gravity and of his thoughtful and radiant smile, of
Deborah’s vivacity and exquisite colouring (she is
like one of her mother’s gay thoughts), of Michael’s
magnetic rotundity, of his blue eyes, of his charming
habit of toppling over like a toy tumbler of lead
and celluloid. And of Rose I am nearly always
conscious, delightfully, when I am awake and often
when I am asleep, and especially when I am in the
church—which is twice every day, to receive Holy
Communion immediately after Reveille and to pray
for a few minutes in the evening. We have a
magnificent old church in this town, as near to
where I am now as the church is to our house in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Larchmont. And right by the tower-door is a big
statue of St. Nicholas of Bari, in his episcopal robes,
and hopping around his feet are two little bits of
babies he saved and brought back to life after they’d
been cut up and pickled. Very nice! You’d like
it! Pray to St. Nicholas for me, and to St.
Stephen, St. Brigid, St. Michael, St. Christopher,
St. Joseph, St. Anthony of Padua, St. Teresa, and
all our other good friends in Heaven, and love me.</p>

April 21, 1918.
</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>I am glad of the auspicious beginning of
Eleanor’s romance. I would so regard it, for I cannot
understand the interpretation which makes marriage
the termination instead of the beginning of a
splendid adventure. If there should ever be the
perfect novel of love, it would begin rather than
end “And they were married.” Would the phrase
continue: “And lived happily ever after”? I doubt
it—but that depends upon the definition of happiness.
I know that you dislike the symbolism which
is the basis of Coventry Patmore’s greatest poems,
but I think you will admit that there is this truth in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
his idea—the relationship of man and wife is like
that of God and the soul in that it must be purified
and strengthened by suffering. Also—to put it on
a lower plane—Eleanor is enough of a poet to take
some enjoyment out of being the wife of a soldier
gone to the wars—or Irish enough, which is the
same thing.</p>

<p>As to the matter of my own blood (you mentioned
this in a previous letter) I did indeed tell a
good friend of mine who edits the book-review page
of a Chicago paper that I was “half Irish.” But I
have never been a mathematician. The point I
wished to make was that a large percentage—which
I have a perfect right to call half—of my ancestry
was Irish. For proof of this, you have only to
refer to the volumes containing the histories of my
mother’s and my father’s families. Of course I
am American, but one cannot be pure American in
blood unless one is an Indian. And I have the good
fortune to be able to claim, largely because of the
wise matrimonial selections of my progenitors on
both sides, Irish blood. And don’t let anyone publish
a statement contradictory to this.</p>

<p>Speaking of publishers, please be very careful
that there is nothing in the book you and Margaret
wrote to offend, in the slightest degree. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
go so far as to say that if the spirit of the book is not
obviously and definitely Catholic—readily so recognised
by Catholic readers—it would grieve me to see
it published with your name attached—grieve me
deeply. I don’t want anyone to say of you, “There
is nothing about that novel to show she is a Catholic.”
I don’t think Catholic writers should spend
their time writing tracts and Sunday-school books,
but I think that the Faith should illuminate everything
they write, grave or gay. The Faith is radiantly
apparent in your last poems. It is in Tom
Daly’s clowning as it is in his loftier moods. Of
course anyone would rather write like Francis
Thompson than like Swinburne. But I can honestly
say that I’d rather write like John Ayscough
than like William Makepiece Thackeray—infinitely
greater artist though Thackeray be. You see, the
Catholic Faith is such a thing that I’d rather write
moderately well about it than magnificently well
about anything else. It is more important, more
beautiful, more necessary than anything else in life.
You and I have seen miracles—let us never cease
to celebrate them. You know that this is not the
first fever of a convert’s enthusiasm—it is the permanent
conviction of a man who prayed daily for
months for the Faith before that grace was given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
him. The Faith has done wonderful things for you,
but I think since I have been in France it has done
more for me. It has carried me through experiences
I could not otherwise have endured. I do not
mean that it has kept me from fear—for I have no
fear of death or wounding whatever. I mean that
it has helped me to endure great and continued
hardships. These hardships are now past—they belong
to last December—but I cannot forget what
made me live through them and bear myself like a
man. Therefore—for this and a multitude of other
reasons, among which let me put that it is my most
earnest request—be zealous in using your exquisite
talent in His service of Whom, I am glad to have
said, Apollo was a shadow. If what you write does
not clearly praise the Lord and his Saints and
Angels, let it praise such types of Heaven as we
know in our life—God knows they are numerous
enough.</p>

<p>Does this sound like the writing of the least desirable
of your aunts? Forgive me if it does, and heed
my request even if it seem unreasonable—the request,
I mean, not to sign your name to the book if
it is not Catholic in spirit. I can honestly offer
“Trees” and “Main Street” to Our Lady, and ask
her to present them, as the faithful work of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
poor unskilled craftsman, to her Son. I hope to be
able to do it with everything I write hereafter—and
to be able to do this is to be a good poet.</p>

<p>Speaking of Poetry, I have read with exquisite
relish, several times, the copy of the Bulletin you
sent me. And always I stop reading—prevented
from continuing by irresistible mirth. God help
us! Let all the world, especially all of it that deals
in thought, beat its breast and repeat after me “God
help us.” Here are young men battling in a strange
land to win back for the people of that land their
decent homes. Here are French peasants (old
men, children and women) kneeling at mass in a
church with a yawning shell hole through the tower.
Among them are American soldiers. And other
American soldiers (God rest their brave young
souls) rest in new graves by a fair road I know.
We hear the crash of shells, the tattoo of machine
guns, we see unearthly lights staining the black sky.
And—Oh, God help us! Send me more bulletins!
I want to read more about Mr. —— whose “mystic”
(of course!) poems, seem to ... “to challenge
comparison with the works of Tagore.” I want to
read more about ... chaunting to crowds of old
ladies who stink of perfume and cold cream and
gasoline, while a young female shakes her shanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
and “gives a visual embodiment of the poet’s idea.”
I want to read about A ... “What a privilege
to be at once a poet and a fairy godmother!” And
I want to read about W ... going West and—just
being himself! God forgive me for being a
Pharisee, and keep me from judging others! But
I do love to read about these things and then go
across the street and drink a large drink with Joe
Brady, meanwhile singing a coarse ballad entitled
“The Old Gray Mare.”</p>

<p>We’re going to be paid to-morrow, I’m glad to
say, so I’ll be able to have a few meals indoors.
This roadside picnic stuff is all right in fair weather,
but French weather is not always what it should be.
I hope your allotment is arriving, but I doubt it. I
think we’ll collect it in our old age. I read recently
that a Civil War Veteran had just succeeded in
collecting some pay due him in 1862—perhaps we’ll
be as lucky. We’ll buy a carton of cigarettes for
Christopher’s youngest son with the first payment.</p>

<p>Your poem “Experience” has lodgment in my
brain and heart and soul. “She walks the way
primroses go.” Simple—isn’t it? that line—to
make it nothing much was required—genius merely.
Thank God there’s you in a world of ——s and ——s. Do
you mind being considered the “one just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
man”? Figuratively I kiss your hand—it was
absurd of me to preach to you who are my mistress
in the art of devotion as in the art of poetry.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>Some mail came to-day and in it was a package
containing ten boxes of tobacco, Merci bien! (when
I get back I’ll talk just like —— or ——.) I received
a box of admirable cigars yesterday (they
were originally awarded to Father Daly in payment
for a contribution to <i>America</i>, and he kindly directed
that they be sent to me).</p>

<p>We are in a new town now (new to us, that is) a
little bit of a place. We have been recently in a
rather large town, where I lived very comfortably.
I am comfortable here (especially since yesterday
afternoon, when I had a hot shower bath and had my
clothes sterilized) but not luxurious. But I’m looking
forward to a much easier and vastly more interesting
time for the rest of my stay in France. I have
asked to be relieved from my office job, and my request
has been granted. I hope on Monday (this is
Saturday night) to become a member of the Regimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Intelligence Section, and the Adjutant tells
me I am to be transferred as a Sergeant, although
I was willing to give up my stripes for the sake of
getting into this work. So henceforth I’ll be peering
at the Germans through field glasses from some
observatory instead of toiling in a dug-out or
crowded office. You wouldn’t want me to come
back round-shouldered and near-sighted, would
you? Well, that would be the result of keeping on
this statistical job much longer. The intelligence
work is absolutely fascinating—you’ll be glad I
took it up.</p>

<p>You would have liked the gutter-babies in our
last town. About a dozen of them used to come out
at meal times and besiege our mess-line. They
brought their dad’s canteens to be filled with coffee,
and they accepted, politely, bread and karo. They
were very nice, and fat, as all French babies are. I
don’t know whether the French are so devoted to
my dear patron St. Nicholas of Bari, because they
love children, as he does, or are devoted to children
because they love him. Anyway they have the nicest
children there are outside of Larchmont Manor
and Heaven (these words mean nearly the same
thing) and they treat them most enthusiastically.
Large crowds of men and women stand for half an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
hour in a busy city street watching a young baby
learn to walk, the baby being decorated, for the occasion,
with his big sister’s broad-brimmed hat.
And also nearly every church has a statue or window
representation of St. Nicholas of Bari with the
three babies he restored to life. It helps me to feel
at home. I hope you and Kenton pray to him often,
he is a very generous saint and has treated me beautifully.</p>

<p>I had a quaint experience to-night. There is no
priest now in this town, but there is a fine old
church, with God in it. Since there is no priest, I
can’t get my daily communion, but I go in occasionally
to say my prayers. Well, to-night there
was a very old lady in the church. She was so crippled
with age and rheumatism that she could not
kneel, so she was huddled up on a bench near the
rail. And she had a white cap on, and she carried a
tall staff with a crutch top such as witches use. She
was very pious, and prayed audibly, making pious
ejaculations, like an old Irish lady. For some time
she didn’t know anyone else was in the church. But
when she found I was there, she waited until I had
said my beads and then she came over to me (rising
with great difficulty and putting on the heavy
wooden shoes that lay beside her). Then she extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
to me her beads. The link between two of
them was undone, and she asked me to mend it. I
tried to do so, but my clumsy fingers had little success.
So I gave her my rosary in exchange for hers—which
I can easily mend with a pair of pincers—and
she was very grateful. But I feel that I got the
best of the bargain, for there may be a special sort
of a blessing attached to beads worn by the gnarled
fingers of one so near God. I could make a rhyme
out of this experience, but it would seem a profanation.
You see some of the possible interpretations
of it, don’t you?</p>

<p>The news about D—— is interesting—well, he
is trying to serve his conscience, and I am trying to
serve mine, and that’s all a gentleman can do. And
since we’re both suffering, I believe we’ve both followed
the right course. There are many ways to
Heaven, but only one Lamp—as I once said in some
verses.</p>

<p>But as to suffering—don’t be pitying me! It’s
you that are doing the suffering, you with no exhilaration
of star-shells and tattoo of machine-guns,
you without the adventure. I feel very selfish,
often.</p>

<p>I love you and you are never away from me.</p>

tea rooms are! I admit that I used to scorn them.
Now I could live in one, enthusiastically. I wouldn’t
mind at all the closeness, the bad service, the
soiled table linen. Why, Max’s Busy Bee sounds
better to me now than Sherry’s used to sound.</p>

<p>“She walks the way Primroses go” reechoes in

me some more poems, at once, please.</p>

<p>It’s time I heard from you again. Some mail

take up Fr. Hayes’ lecture offer. You can make
your lectures chiefly readings. Get Dr. Pallen to

<p>Your friends are a bit impertinent, I think. I
don’t claim to be a learned French scholar (although
I have talked French every day for six
months). But I do claim to know the name of the
place where I lived in constant danger of death for
six weeks, where many of my friends gave their
lives for their country. It is Rouge Bo<em>u</em>quet, not
Rouge Bo<em>s</em>quet. I’ll be deeply grieved if it appears
in print incorrectly. Also, I wish the grace in
“Holy Ireland” to stand as I wrote it. It is just
as Frank Driscoll said it on that unforgettable
night—it is the grace used in Jesuit houses. Please<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
see to this, and don’t let all the world revise my mss.
I rather expected you’d like the poem better, but

<p>The above is rather stern and brusque, isn’t it?
Well I wrote it in rather stirring times—now only
memories. I am resting now, in a beautiful place—on
a high hilltop covered with pine and fir trees. I
never saw any mountain-place in America I thought
better to look at or from. I sleep on a couch made
soft with deftly laid young spruce boughs and eat
at a table set under good, kind trees. A great improvement
on living in a dug-out and even (to my
mind) an improvement on a room with a bed in a
village. I am not on a furlough, I am working, but
my work is of a light and interesting kind and fills
only six out of twenty-four hours. So I have plenty
of time for writing, and have started a prose-sketch
(based on an exciting and colourful experience
of the last month) which I will send you soon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
<em>Everything</em> I write, I think, in prose or verse,

<p>I wish I could tell you more about my work, but
at present I cannot. But there are advertised in
the American magazines many books about the Intelligence
Service—get one of them and you’ll find
why I like my job. The work Douglas is doing is
not allied to mine. Only I suppose he’ll have a commission.
I won’t work for one, because I don’t

As to being worried about you because it expresses

physical pain) is beautiful and wholesome and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>

a moustache, and not a “morning pout.” <i lang="fr">Mechante.</i>
A long moustache I have (illustration of
moustache) <i lang="fr">comme ca</i>. Also, I have thick hair
which stands up (illustration) <i lang="fr">comme ci</i>. I had my
head shaved last November, you know, and it had a
good effect. My letter is thrilling, isn’t it, with all
these martial details? A veritable cross-section of
battle, a flower from No Man’s Land. Well, I am
sending some battling picture-postcards soon which
you will find amusing, I think—portraits, in two
striking histrionic poses, of myself. You know now,
from my previous letters, that I am no longer (I
thank God!) doing statistics, so gently, but widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
and most firmly, correct the statement that I have a
bullet-proof job. I had one, but succeeded, after
two months’ intriguing, in getting rid of it. It
wasn’t a shell-proof job—nothing in a real regiment
is. (Such jobs are in the Ordnance or Supply Departments,
back of the lines.) It wasn’t shell-proof,
I say, and if I should be squashed by a shell,
wouldn’t you hate to have it said that I was nobly
holding my post in the office, or bravely manning
my typewriter? Now, I’m doing work I love—and
work you may be proud of. None of the drudgery
of soldiering, but a double share of glory and thrills.
But it is not so glorious and thrilling as you.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>I don’t know just what kind of a mental picture
you have of my present life—to be accurate it would
need to be rather kaleidoscopic, for my activities
and the spheres of them vary frequently and
greatly. But this afternoon you (or perhaps not
you, but readers of Empey and Private Peat and
the rest of that mob of war writers—thank God,
let me Pharisaicly say, that I am not one of them—would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
do so) would have been amazed at the martial
picture before you, had you seen me. Just outside
the edge of the forest of firs and spruce in which we
fourteen men live is a lovely meadow. There,
among the knee-high buttercups, lay in the May
sunshine all afternoon three warriors—myself being
one. Whiles we smoked and gazed at the lovely
valley miles below us—whiles we took turns in reading
aloud from—what do you suppose? The Oxford
Book of English Verse! We read Gray’s
Elegy, the first chorus from Atalanta in Calydon,
“They told me, Heraclitus,” that witch poem of
William Bell Scott, “Love in the Valley,” “Lake
Isle of Innisfree,” “Keith of Ravelston,” and half
a dozen other poems, all of which brought you most
poignantly and beautifully before me. No, they
didn’t bring you before me—you are always before
me and with me and in my heart and brain—but it’s
dangerous to write this—it draws so tight the cords
that bind me to you that they cut painfully into my
flesh. Well, we are to be together sometime, inevitably,
and soon in terms of eternity. For we are
absolutely one, incomplete apart, and in Heaven is
completeness. How unhappy must lovers be who
have not the gracious gift of faith!</p>

<p>There is to be an Homeric banquet at our house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
one day—the day when I exhibit to my comrades
the glory of my life—yourself. You will like them
all—Watson (a gifted artist from Richmond, who
is now at work on a fine drawing which must accompany
Rouge Bouquet in <i>Scribner’s</i>), Bob Lee,
Titterton (my especial friend), Beck, Mott, Kerrigan,
Levinson—say a prayer for them all, they’re
brave men and good, and splendid company. They
are all men of education, and breeding, and humour,
and we have fine times. Dangers shared together
and hardships mutually borne develops in us a sort
of friendship I never knew in civilian life, a friendship
clean of jealousy and gossip and envy and suspicion—a
fine hearty roaring mirthful sort of thing,
like an open fire of whole pine-trees in a giant’s
castle, or a truly timed bombardment with eight-inch
guns. I don’t know that this last figure will
strike you as being particularly happy, but it would
if you’d had the delight of going to war.</p>

<p>Right here I had to pause to discuss theology with
Watson, Titterton, Levinson and Jongberg. Jongberg
is up here for a brief spell; he is a Swedish-Irishman,
and now he is posing for St. Michael for
Watson, using a bayonet for a sword. Levinson
(in full uniform, including belt and helmet) is being
model for the soldiers leaving Rouge Bouquet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
for Heaven. He is a quaint little French-Jewish-American,
with whom we have a lot of fun. They
all trooped into the room where Titterton and I sit
writing to our respective sweethearts, to ask about
the style of St. Michael’s sword and that of his halo.
These questions settled, Watson became enamoured
of the idea of angels saluting, and devised a whole
manual of arms for angels—as “Angels, attention!
Wings raised, by the numbers. 1 up! 2 down!
Wings flap! Hey you down there! what’s the
matter with you? Don’t you know enough to keep
your hands down when you flap your wings? Awkward
squad for you to-morrow!” Then they went
back to their work.</p>

<p>Well, I don’t know how long the Intelligence
Section is to stay in this lovely summer resort of
a place, but it’s certainly fine while it lasts. And
I am very fortunate to have such a crowd as this to
work with. I never was with so congenial a company
in civilian life. Fr. O’Donnell came up to see
us yesterday—he is stationed not far away. Fr.
Duffy has an assistant—Fr. Kennedy—a Jesuit,
thank God! I have not met him yet. He is a
brother of the publishers of Barclay Street. I have
a new stripe—an inverted chevron of bright gold
on the left cuff for six months service. Let you be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
proud of that too, please, and let my children be
proud of it. That is all the news except that I love
you.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>To-day I was made very happy by receiving two
nice little ridiculous letters from you—one of which
considered itself to be long. As to Sr. Mary Leo—if
you happen to be writing to her (you will be, for
I told her to ask you for “Rouge Bouquet”) ask her
by all means to tell you how her grandmother
taught her geography. It’s an absolutely delightful
story, and she’s a delightful old saint.</p>

<p>You say Tad will go “in a few months.” I’m glad
I’m not Tad. There are many reasons for this, of
course, but I mean I am especially glad I’m not to
go in a few months. I’m glad I’m a Sergeant in the
69th, a volunteer regiment, the bravest and best
regiment in the army. I’m glad I have a golden
service chevron on my left arm—that means six
months service in France, and is better than two
bars on my shoulder, which would mean only three
months stay at Plattsburg. If I get an honorable
wound that will unfit me for soldiering but not for
civilian work, that civilian work will not be hack-writing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
It may be straight reporting, or editing,
or writing (<i>Evening World</i> at $80 a week, for instance)
a weekly essay-column, or dramatic criticism
(this last appeals to me strongly). Also I’ll
do less lecturing and more oratory—bombastic,
thundering, literary, Henry Woodfin Grady oratory!
It is exciting, and lecturing isn’t, especially.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I find myself approving your plan of
getting literary work, although doing it makes me
feel like a coloured man approving his wife’s plan of
taking in washing. You relieve my mind greatly by
your willingness to keep your name off the book.
I thought I would acknowledge to you the pleasure
I got from “A Wind Rose in the Night.” It is a
holy and dear poem.</p>

<p>Please see that Kenton learns to serve Mass,
won’t you? Sorry to keep teasing you about this,
but you never write anything about it.</p>

<p>Your poem “To a Sick Child” is beautiful, and
“cookies” is the making of it. I love you.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>I didn’t get your letter expressing enthusiastic
approval of “Rouge Bouquet” until I had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
two others just mentioning it. I certainly am glad
the poem “got” you, as it got me. The Regiment—and
soldiers outside the Regiment as high as a
Brigadier General—are wonderfully enthusiastic.
The Brigadier General had twenty-four copies
made to send his friends. Of course we are especially
moved by it because the event is so close to us.
But to appreciate it you should have heard taps
played and at a soldier’s funeral. P.&nbsp;C. ought to
know the distinction between peacemakers and pacifists.
I wonder he didn’t include St Michael in his
catalogue of pacifists. We are peace-makers, we
soldiers of the 69th, we are risking our lives to bring
back peace to the simple, generous, gay, pious people
of France, whom anyone (knowing them as I
have come to know them in the last six months)
must pity and admire and love. They are an invaded
people—and invaded people <em>always are right</em>.
The careful study of certain ghostly villages (I
cannot forget them) has taught me where I would
have stood in the 60’s and that is on the side of the
invaded Southern States. God keep me from ever
being ordered to take part in an invasion of a peaceful
land! So long as I am helping drive out the
invader, I know I’m right—and all questions of international
politics are of no importance whatever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Here are nice old ladies, fat babies, jovial humorous
men, and little girls just after making their
First Communions. They’ve been driven out of
their pretty sleepy little villages. They want to get
back and mend the shell holes in the roof and go to
school and take their place drinking red wine of an
evening according to their tastes and ages. Well,
we men of the 69th are helping to give these people
back their homes—and perhaps to prevent our
homes from one day being taken from us by the
same Power—of whom nothing at all worse need be
said than that it is an invader. And St. Patrick and
St. Bridgid and St. Columkill and all the other
Saints are with us—they are no more pacifists than
they are Roycrofters! And God keep us from
Washington Square! No Man’s Land is a damn
sight healthier place—I have tried both, and I know
what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>And as for you, you young flippertigibbet, you
won’t be middle-aged, you say? Well, we’ll see
about that! I’ll probably come back with one eye,
one arm, one leg and a horrible temper, and turn
your hair white in a day. Stop calling any child of
ours “Billy.” When you referred to “Billy” in previous
letters I thought you meant some rather unfortunately
named dog or cat. Now I am annoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
to find out you meant Michael. The habit of so
designating him probably started humorously—please
stop it at once.</p>

<p>I have not read “The Tree of Heaven,” to which
you refer in a recent letter. But I have read Carnival—and
if when I get back to the States I find that
you really think such books are “fine,” as you say
in your letter, I’ll grab a baby (probably young
Michael) and start for whatever South American
Republic or other bellicose land has need of the services
of a ranting, roaring, slashing, dashing young
Sergeant, fresh from the ranks of the quarrelsome
Irish, veteran of the Great War.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>I enclose three bits of verse by various hands.
“A Nun’s Prayer for a Soldier” is by dear old
Sister Mary Leo. The flattering sonnet was sent
to me by Sr. Mary Emerentia, having been copied
from a paper published by the girls of St. Mary’s
College, Notre Dame, Indiana. I destroyed Sr.
Emerentia’s letter before I copied down the
author’s name, so I couldn’t write to thank her, unfortunately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
“The Green Estaminet” I want carefully
preserved, for it must go in every anthology
made by you or me or anybody we know. I like it
better than any war poem I’ve read since I became
a soldier, and I deeply regret that I didn’t write it.
Many and many a jovial evening I have spent in
just such bistrals as the poet describes. Dear old
Madame—she always has that “strange disease,”
and she finds that white bread is good for it—and in
exchange for that white bread (from army kitchens)
she gives the delicious soft-crumbed brittle-crusted
war-bread, better than any bread in the
States. “The great round songs begin”—they do,
indeed! “Bing Bang Bingen on the Rhine!”
“Down in the Heart of the Gas House District,”
“Sidewalks of New York,” and always “Madelon,”
in which the French soldiers in the corner enthusiastically
join. Cecil Chesterton told me he always
judged a country by its drinking-places. Well,
here are the merriest, bravest drinking places in the
world. If the States go dry, I’m going to bundle all
you young critters over here to live—a comfortable,
humorous, Catholic country. Honestly, the
only drawback to living in this country is the absence
of you and your gang. I’d like a house on the
very mountain top I now inhabit, and I know you’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
enjoy it tremendously. I’m perfectly serious about
this, and look forward to bringing you here.</p>

<p>Write oftener, and longer! I love you.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>A terrible thing, this war, what with a pine forest
to live in, all the latest novels to read, and bridge
every evening. And now I am preparing for a
short week-end in a certain nice small city, an hour’s
walk through the forest and across the mountains.
It is a lovely forest in which to wander of a June
day—so deliberately European—a forest whose tall
evergreen trees and smooth brown floor suggest all
the folk tales I ever heard your dear voice beautify
for our children’s delight. Reaching this certain
town, I have interesting things to do—to collect my
pay for one thing. To get mail—I hope from you.
To go to confession to Fr. Duffy or Fr. Kennedy,
S.&nbsp;J., our new assistant chaplain, or to some curé
with thin hands and long white hair. To drink a
bottle of beer at the Sergeants’ Club—among my
brother noncoms, French, Italian and American, in
horizon blue, green and olive drab respectively. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
mail to you this letter and a splendid drawing for
“Rouge Bouquet,” by Emmett Watson, of ours.
To dine sumptuously on steak and fried potatoes
and Pinard at a merry bistral on a side-street, where
Madame la patronne will present me with a sprig of
lilies of the valley, which I (imagine a boutonierre
with an American uniform!) will present to the
baby of the tailor’s daughter. To attend the movies—two
sous! To sleep between clean sheets in a
hotel-bedroom—half a franc! And to-morrow to
be (gold service stripe flashing in the sunlight,
trench-stick jauntily swinging) a part of the many-coloured
Sunday afternoon procession along a
certain broad avenue. Then back to my forest-lodge
for supper.</p>

<p>I have written a long topical poem about a hike
which I’ll send you soon.</p>

<p class="dear">Dear Aline:</p>

<p>So far, I have told about six people about your
rejoicing in the fact that the possession of a kitten
justifies you in purchasing a bird-cage. An absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
delightful character-revelation—that is, the
revelation of a delightful character. And the most
genuine sample of you I have had since last November.</p>

<p>I am writing this letter in the end of one of our
barracks, which its partition cuts to make an airy
office for the Supply Sergeant of Headquarters
Company. You’d like him very much—a very
beautiful person of about my age, a playwright by
profession, educated in Paris. At the other end of
the long table sits a bridge party, of which the members
are the Supply Sergeant (Lemist Esler is his
name), Howard Young (who was a Marine before
he became a fighting Irisher), Sergeant Kenneth
Russell (a wealthy and charming business man of
very literary taste, who knows most of the living
poets we know and revels in the Oxford Book of
English Verse), and Tom O’Kelly, who has the
most beautiful tenor voice you ever heard. He is
a professional singer from Dublin, with very tightly
curled close-cropped hair, a reddish brown face, and
the build of a prize-fighter. In the lulls of the game
he sings snatches of “Digging for Gould” and other
nice ballads. Admirable person.</p>

<p>I am with the Regiment now—the Intelligence

from which I wrote you many letters. Now we are
in very flat country, the flattest I ever saw. Very
violent flowers, chiefly scarlet poppies and small
blue things, cornflowers, I believe. Gloriously hot,
with good swimming nearby, and the best sort of
shower-bath, obtainable by merely sitting under the
spout of a pump while an obliging friend turns the
handle.</p>

<p>Your letter of May twenty-sixth came after I
had received a June letter. I am delighted to hear
of Kenton’s confirmation and of his choice of a name—St.
Stephen is a gallant gentleman and a true
friend and does wonderful things for me.</p>

<p>I’m not very enthusiastic about that group picture
of office-workers in which I appear—I like
myself better as I am now, a soldier instead of a
clerk, visiting the office only occasionally—to work
on my history. And I’m ever so much happier now
than when the picture was taken.</p>

<p>Is Kenton serving Mass yet? <em>Please</em> have him
do so. And please send me my Anthology—I believe
restrictions no longer keep packages from soldiers.

<h3>I—<span class="smcap">Water-colour</span></h3>

<p>Pushing my way through the chattering throng
of my brown-clad mates to the rail of the troop-ship,
I look at still water, greasy and opaque. A touch
of sunlight makes it splendid with rainbows, a great
prismatic expanse, beautiful, more beautiful than
clear water could be. Broken oars shatter the rainbow,
bringing a black, clumsy rowboat close to our
ship’s side. Around the black boat the rainbow settles.
The rower rests his oars and lifts graceful entreating
arms. He wears pale blue overalls. In the
stern of his boat is a little girl in a cardinal cloak.
On her head is one of the caps that make the French
sailors look so gay and gentle, a flat, round, blue
thing with a red pompom. She claps her hands
when cooks lean through the portholes and throw
loaves of bread to her father.</p>

<h3>II—<span class="smcap">Breakfast</span></h3>

<p>I may breakfast in either of two ways. I may, as
I pass a steaming field-kitchen, hold out by its long
handle a shining aluminum basin. John Wilkert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
will put into it a big ladleful of rice, and Leo Maher
will pour golden syrup over it. Also, before I leave
the line I shall have three long strips of broiled
bacon and two thick slices of white bread, and a
canteen cup full of hot, sweet coffee. The breakfast
room is a meadow or the roadside across from the
barracks. There is good company, hungry and
mirthful. And over our heads noisy battalions of
crows maneuver, advancing, retreating, hoarsely
shouting down to us news of what awaits us beyond
the frozen hills.</p>

<p>Or I may go to the House by the Fountain.
Pierre’s “permission” is over, so he will not come in
from the stable to smoke my tobacco and tell me of
life and death in the trenches. <i lang="fr">Grandpere</i> sits by
the fire, now and then blowing it to flame by forcing
his scant old breath upon it through a long hollow
tube, and toasting for me a thick slice of war-bread.
Madame superintends the heating of the big
iron pot of this morning’s milk and the three-legged
pot of coffee. Now my bowl—a little precious sugar
in the bottom—is filled with hot milk. Madame
deftly pours black coffee into it, and it becomes
richly brown. I break my toast into it and eat
eagerly—more eagerly than does demure little
Francine, who sits opposite me, her school books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
beside her on the bench. She has large innocent
brown eyes like her father’s. Her hands are so tiny
that I am surprised at her dexterity with the large
pewter spoon. I am afraid that if I stare at her I
shall embarrass her and make her spill <i lang="fr">cafe au lait</i>
on her immaculate pinafore. On the great stone
mantel over the fire are a spent seventy-five millimetre
shell curiously engraved with wreaths of
roses, a pink china pig and a brass crucifix. A
bugle sounds by the barracks. I give Madame her
half-franc. I take my belt and rifle. “Bon jour,
Monsieur,” says Madame, “A demain!” Some day
instead of “a demain” they will say “au revoir.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_233">“TRY A TIN TO-DAY”</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">“And now</span>,” said John Potts, whirling
around on the piano-stool and throwing his
lank forelock back with a jerk of his head, “we will
interpret Grace Mallon’s soul!”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait till she comes, John!” boomed the Rev.
Morris Gildell. “She was at the Karl Marx Forum
in our parish-house last night, and she said positively
she’d be down here this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do wait!” said Mrs. Anna Watkins Wilbur,
placing her fat hands, covered with rings set
with semiprecious stones, over those of the pianist.
“Do wait! It will be wonderful for her to hear it!”</p>

<p>The host of the occasion was Edwin Marmaduke,
painter. He was at present engaged in spooning
Arabian incense out of a cocoa-tin and putting it
into a large bronze thurible, which hung before a
plaster replica of Rodin’s “Le Baiser.” The incense
caught fire, and dense clouds of fragrant
smoke filled the little studio. Then Marmaduke
turned his pale but agreeable face to his guests.</p>

<p>“No, do it now!” he commanded. “Perhaps you
and Arthura will bring her with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>So John Potts struck a few minor chords, and
Arthura Lewis lifted her pale-green mantle in both
thin arms, smiled at the low ceiling, closed her eyes,
and danced. She did not really dance. She merely
bent and kicked and gestured, approximately in
rhythm with the music.</p>

<p>She was not really Miss Arthura Lewis, either.
Her first name, which she had discarded as too
usual, was Alice and her last name was Potts, for
she was the pianist’s wife. They were known to live
together in the little apartment across Patchin
Place from Marmaduke’s studio, but the fact of
their marriage was scrupulously kept a secret from
the other members of their emancipated circle. No
liaison was ever hidden from the world more zealously
than was the regularity and mid-Victorian respectability
of this seeming “free comradeship.”</p>

<p>So John Potts played and Arthura danced, and
the theme they were interpreting was Grace Mallon’s
soul. Edwin Marmaduke’s eyes were turned
toward Arthura, but he did not see her. Nor did he
see Grace’s soul. He saw her eyes—very gray and
lovely—and her hair, which was golden-brown and
had an indefinable air of mirth about it.</p>

<p>Marmaduke loved Grace better than cigarettes,
or incense, or art; better even than the school of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
painting of which he was the acknowledged master,
the school which proudly accepted a name first derisively
given it—the Incomprehensiblists. So,
while Arthura twisted and turned and John Potts
hammered out discords, he thought of Grace’s
beauty and charm.</p>

<p>To do him justice, he did not think of her great
wealth. In fact, he did not like to think of her
wealth, for that wealth came from her father’s success
in a most unesthetic business. Grace was the
daughter of “Try a Tin To-day” Mallon, who was
known in the world of canned goods as the Salmon King.</p>

<p>There was no vulgar hand-clapping after the artists
had finished their interpretation of Grace’s soul;
but the Rev. Morris Gildell rattled his spoon
against the sides of his teacup, while Mrs. Anna
Watkins Wilbur sighed ecstatically and clanked
her chain of heavy amber beads. Even in the act of
lighting a cigarette, John Potts started dramatically
and pointed toward the open window.</p>

<p>“La voilà!” he exclaimed. “We have summoned
her! I hear the rumble of her chariot-wheels.”</p>

<p>There did indeed come from the cobbles of Patchin
Place the whir and snort of an automobile.
Soon the great gong on the wall clanged viciously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
causing Arthura Lewis to shudder and clasp her
long, white hands to her eyes. Edwin Marmaduke
sped down the four flights of stairs that intervened
between his studio and the street door.</p>

<p>His deserted guests looked at one another expectantly.</p>

<p>“Dear Grace!” said Mrs. Anna Watkins Wilbur.
“I hope she came alone. I can’t stand that friend
of hers—what is his name?—that Watson person.”</p>

<p>“He is a terrible bromid,” said Arthura Lewis,
lighting a cigarette. “He’s so very—so very, shall
I say, salmony!”</p>

<p>This was said with humorous intent and received
with kindly laughter.</p>

<p>“But what has Mr. Watson to do with salmon,
anyway?” asked John Potts. “Does he catch them,
or what is it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing so exciting as that,” said the Rev.
Morris Gildell, with a great chuckle. “He merely
celebrates them. He is the advertising manager of
the Mallon Salmon Company, and his chief claim to
immortality is that he invented the ‘Try a Tin To-day’
slogan. You know those great pink pictures
of ridiculous-looking fish that we see in public
vehicles and on the highways and byways, each one
holding out a can bearing the legend, ‘Try a Tin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
To-day’? Watson is responsible for those mutilations
of the landscape.”</p>

<p>“Does Watson paint them himself?” asked Mrs.
Anna Watkins Wilbur. “He looks capable of it.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Morris Gildell issued another of those
shouts of laughter which made the women’s clubs
believe him masculine and hearty.</p>

<p>“Excellent!” he cried, putting an approving hand
on Mrs. Anna Watkins Wilbur’s fat, bare shoulder.
“Oh, excellent! No, Watson doesn’t paint them,
but he does worse—he inspires them. He persuades
some poor devil of an artist to make these hideous
caricatures of the truth. He is the Mæcenas of the
‘Try a Tin To-day’ school of painting.”</p>

<p>After waiting for the murmur of amusement to
die down, the Rev. Morris Gildell continued:</p>

<p>“Grace brought Watson to the Feminist Conference
at our church last week, and several people
asked me what a rare, free spirit like her could see in
such a clod. I suppose she feels that she must go
around with him occasionally because he is so useful
to her father. But I hope she doesn’t think of
marrying him!”</p>

<p>“Marrying him!” exclaimed Mrs. Anna Watkins
Wilbur, Arthura Lewis, and John Potts in unison.
“I hope not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>“Why,” said Arthura Lewis, “it would be a
tragedy for an emancipated woman like Grace to
marry at all! Not to speak of marrying such a soulless,
brainless animal as that David Watson! I’d
as soon see <span class="locked">her—”</span></p>

<p>But the conversation was interrupted by the
opening of the studio door and the entrance of
Grace and their young host.</p>

<p>Edwin Marmaduke seemed somehow to look
younger than before. He had lost a little of his expression
of languor and disdain; and Grace was the
very personification of radiant girlhood. In spite
of her knowledge of her own good looks and good
clothes, she was charmingly deferential to these
people, whom she considered intellectuals. Her
naively respectful greeting to the Rev. Morris Gildell
seemed for the moment to restore to that drawing-room
revolutionist some strange lost dignity.</p>

<p>Men and women alike greeted the young girl with
genuine friendliness. When her gray motor-cloak
had been hung over the corner of an easel, and she
had been seated on one of the few real chairs the
studio boasted, and served with sweet biscuits, a cup
of tea, and a cigarette, then the great event of the
afternoon occurred—the unveiling of Marmaduke’s
portrait of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>The blinds were drawn—for the Incomprehensiblist
painting is best appreciated in semidarkness.
The incense-pot received some new fuel; John Potts
played something “very golden” on the piano; and
Edwin Marmaduke reverently drew back the gay
Indian scarf that covered his masterpiece.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>For a detailed description of Edwin Marmaduke’s
“Soul Study in B-Minor—for G.&nbsp;M.,” the
reader is referred to the introduction to the catalogue
of the “Seven Rebels” exhibition at the Stein
Galleries, or to the admirable essay “Incomprehensiblism—a
Step Forward,” which appeared in
that sprightly but short-lived weekly review, the
<cite>Ultimate Democracy</cite>. This at least was obvious—that
the portrait was large and mauve; this at least
was generally agreed upon—that it was wonderful.</p>

<p>The Rev. Morris Gildell defiantly, Mrs. Anna
Watkins Wilbur cooingly, Arthura Lewis prayerfully,
Grace Mallon respectfully, Edwin Marmaduke
himself modestly—all said it was wonderful.
And after Mrs. Anna Watkins Wilbur had embraced
the young painter, and his other guests had
clasped his hand, and they had all said “Wonderfull”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
many, many times, they clattered down the
uncarpeted stairs to the street.</p>

<p>All, that is, but one—Grace Mallon. She still
remained in the old Italian chair, holding an empty
cup and an unlighted cigarette. She looked out of
the window into dusty Patchin Place, and one
slender, unjeweled hand lay on the sill. It was an
attractive hand although the sun had turned it a
shade darker than that of Edwin Marmaduke. It
seemed firm and soft at the same time.</p>

<p>Edwin was, after all, human, and therefore he
seized it; but Grace withdrew it from his grasp—not
very abruptly, however.</p>

<p>“Now, Edwin,” she said, “you must be very
proper and mid-Victorian and all that sort of thing,
since I’m being a reckless, forward young woman
and staying here in your studio all alone with you.
Now sit down there like a good boy and listen to
me. Heavens! I wonder what David <em>would</em> say
if he knew I was doing this!”</p>

<p>“Why do you care what David Watson would
say?” asked Edwin, gently swinging the thurible to
and fro before his goddess. “He’s busy with his
‘Try a Tin To-day’ pictures. He isn’t thinking
about you or anything else that is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Stop swinging that incense thing around. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
make me nervous!” Grace replied irrelevantly. “I
hate that stuff; it makes me think about when I had
whooping-cough. Of course I don’t care about
what David thinks, silly! Last night he came up
to the house, and he said something that hurt me
very much.”</p>

<p>She paused interrogatively. Edwin put the extinguished
thurible on a teakwood stand, dusted his
fingers on a yellow silk handkerchief, and sat down
on a cushion at Grace’s feet.</p>

<p>“Well, what did he say?” he asked.</p>

<p>Grace’s colour had risen, making her more adorable
than ever.</p>

<p>“Really, Edwin,” she said, “I sometimes think
that you are almost too skilful in repressing your
emotions. I said he hurt me very much.”</p>

<p>Edwin threw his cigarette into the coal-scuttle
with a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>“My dear Grace,” he said, “what would you have
me do? Challenge him to a duel? Of course I’m
tremendously sorry; but why do you talk to such an
animal as Watson?”</p>

<p>Grace looked at him with a rather cynical smile.</p>

<p>“You men are pretty much alike, after all,” she
said. “What David said that hurt me was just like
what you are saying about him. He made fun of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
you and your painting—of course, that hurt me terribly—and
then he actually had the nerve—the impudence
to <em>forbid</em> me to come to your studio!
Think of it! David Watson, whose only idea of art
is a stupid fish holding a tin of dad’s salmon and
saying ‘Try a Tin To-day’—that man to tell me
what to do and what not to do! I’ll tell you what
I did. I forbade him ever to come to my home or
to speak to me again! When I came down here this
afternoon, I stopped at dad’s office purposely. I
know David was watching me when I left, and I
said to Leon, ‘Take me to Mr. Marmaduke’s studio
in Patchin Place’—loud, so he’d hear me!”</p>

<p>Edwin looked almost handsome as he smiled up
at her from his cushion.</p>

<p>“That’s my brave little comrade!” he said. “And
soon we shall be married, sha’n’t we? Remember,
you’ll keep your maiden name, and you won’t promise
to honour or obey me, or any of that cruel rubbish.
Gildell will use that lovely, ‘Polyrhythmic
Ritual for a Free Mating,’ and there’ll be just the
people we love best present. Arthura will dance,
and it will all be wonderful!”</p>

<p>Grace gripped the arms of her chair and moistened
her lips nervously.</p>

<p>“Edwin,” she said, “I haven’t told you yet why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
I stayed here to-day. I told dad to come here at
six o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Mallon coming here at six o’clock!” said
Edwin, rising to his feet. “Why, it’s five minutes
to six now!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s coming here right away. And, Edwin—he
knows,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“You told him?” asked Edwin in unconcealed
amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, I told him, idiot!” said Grace, springing up
from her chair. “How else do you suppose he
knows? Do you think he read my burning passion
written on my brow? Have some sense! Did you
never hear of a girl telling her own father that she
was engaged?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” said Edwin. “Of course! I understand.
But what did he say, why is he coming here?”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Grace, drawing on a white
glove hurriedly and splitting it in the process. “I
told him last night, right after David went away;
and he said he didn’t like artists and didn’t like you—don’t
be angry, Edwin, he’s only seen you three
times. I told him you were really a great painter,
and he said that he wanted me to be happy, and
that he’d have a talk with you and see what you were
made of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>“See what I am made of!” said Edwin with a
sneer. “Why, does he <span class="locked">think—”</span></p>

<p>“Now, Edwin, please, please, <em>please</em>, don’t say
anything bright!” said Grace. “You know dad has
had only me to talk to since mother died, and he
isn’t used to bright people. He doesn’t like them.
Now be sensible, and—here he comes now!”</p>

<p>They had not heard the great motor-car swing
around the corner of Jefferson Market and come
to a stop at the entrance to Patchin Place; but they
heard the clang of the gong on the studio wall, and
together they went to the street-door and brought
the Salmon King up the rickety stairs to the studio.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>James Mallon was what is called a captain of industry.
That is, he was one of those men who are
always shown by the realistic cartoonists to be
grossly fat, with very small heads, tremendous cigars,
and suits of clothes covered with a chaste pattern
of dollar-marks.</p>

<p>He no more looked the part, however, than you
look the part of the <em>Common People</em>. He was
slender, graceful, and modestly dressed; he had a
neat, white mustache, thin gray hair, and a mildly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
humorous expression. He loved his motherless
daughter, his business, golf, pinocle, Smithfield
ham, buckwheat cakes and maple-sirup, dry Sauterne,
and detective-stories. He did not wear spats.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallon sat in the Italian chair, and after a
brief survey of the room, turned to his postulant
son-in-law a puzzled but amiable face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Marmaduke,” he said, “don’t you think that
you and I could talk a little more comfortably if
I sent this youngster of mine home? Run away,
Grace, and have Leon take you straight to the
house. I’ll be back in time for dinner.”</p>

<p>Grace gave her father that birdlike peck which is
the traditional filial kiss, and ran down-stairs in
accordance with his directions. She went to her car,
and called Leon from his conversation with her
father’s chauffeur. There arose a rumble and a
rasping roar, and her car sped over the cobblestones
to the corner and up Sixth Avenue.</p>

<p>Oh, woman, in our hours of ease, what a double-faced
hussy you are, anyway! Grace’s car went
away—presumably home—but Grace stayed behind.
She had left the street-door of the house ajar.
She tiptoed up the stairs to the top floor, where her
father and her lover were engaged in important private
discourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>She came to a halt about three steps from the top,
and perched in the dust with her golden-brown head
on a level with the broad streak of light which
marked the bottom of the studio door. A shameless
eavesdropper, she listened greedily.</p>

<p>First she heard her father’s voice:</p>

<p>“I have heard your paintings praised highly by
critics whose opinions I respect,” it said. “The fact
that I myself fail to appreciate their merit is by no
means to your discredit. I am not a connoisseur,
and I am very old-fashioned in all my tastes. But
I must say frankly that your success as a painter of
ultramodern pictures scarcely seems to me to
qualify you to marry my daughter.”</p>

<p>She half hoped, half feared, that Edwin would
say:</p>

<p>“I love your daughter and she loves me. That
makes our union necessary and right.”</p>

<p>But instead he said, in a low, tense voice which she
had never heard him use before:</p>

<p>“But I may say without boasting that my art is
not a failure, even financially. I have sold six
paintings since last May, and the smallest check I
received was for one hundred and twenty-five
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” her father replied courteously. “I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
glad to hear it, Mr. Marmaduke—very glad to hear
it. I did not know that the public was sufficiently
fond of these new and unusual forms of art to invest
money in them. I see that I was wrong. But you
must forgive me, Mr. Marmaduke, if I say that in
my opinion the demand for—what is it you call
them? I am getting old, and my memory is not
what it was—ah, yes, thank you—the demand for
Incomprehensiblist paintings is not likely to be
of great duration. The public is fickle, sir; it
has no use for last year’s novelties. Can you expect
to invent new methods of painting yearly for
its pleasure? You would have found it more
profitable, in the long run, to paint in the traditional
manner.”</p>

<p>Edwin did not speak for several seconds. Then
he said, with an air of deliberation:</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Mallon. I think you are wrong. I
tried painting in the traditional manner, and I made
much less money than I am making now. Except
for commercial work, the only sort of painting that
pays to-day is—well, what you would call freak
painting.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Grace heard her father say. “Exactly—except
for commercial work! There is a field for a
young man! I cannot blame you for being an idealist;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
but you wish to marry my daughter, and I confess
that I should prefer to see her married to a successful
commercial draftsman—say, an artist connected
with some sound advertising agency—than
to—well, to an Incomprehensiblist.”</p>

<p>The listening girl smiled at her father’s words.
Edwin Marmaduke and advertisements! It was
an amusingly fantastic combination.</p>

<p>She heard Edwin cross the room and open a door.
Then he seemed to be taking something from a
closet. There was clattering and grating, as if canvases
were being moved about.</p>

<p>“Before I show you these,” he said, “I must ask
you to promise to treat this matter as strictly confidential.”</p>

<p>“Of course I promise, Mr. Marmaduke,” said her
father. “But really I am not competent to judge
your <span class="locked">work—”</span></p>

<p>Edwin made no oral answer. From the sounds
that came to her Grace conjectured that he was lifting
and placing one of his paintings on an easel.
She wondered which one it was—certainly it could
not be her portrait!</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” she heard her father say. “Good
Lord!”</p>

<p>Then came silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Frantic with curiosity, Grace rose from the step
and tried to look into the room through the keyhole.
The presence of a key made her effort unavailing.
She heard the rustle of pictures hastily turned, and
her father’s iteration of “Good Lord!”</p>

<p>Then Edwin spoke.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “you see that my work has some
practical value, don’t you? You recognise these
drawings, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Recognise them!” said Mr. Mallon. “I should
say I did. Do you mean to tell <span class="locked">me—”</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Edwin. “They’re my work, all of
them. Watson let the Parker Company handle
their campaign, and I’ve done all their high-class
work for the past three years.”</p>

<p>The Parker Company! Grace dimly remembered
hearing that name. Yes, David Watson had
said something about the Parker Company.</p>

<p>“I don’t sign any of this stuff,” said Edwin, “but
it’s all mine. I originated that idea of the fish holding
a can in his fin. I make all the ‘Try a Tin To-day’
pictures.”</p>

<p>She was at first too stunned to move. Vaguely
she heard her father’s laugh, vaguely she heard him
congratulating Edwin and inviting him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
house. Then, with a sense of walking in her sleep,
she found herself at the foot of the stairs, fumbling
at the catch of the street-door. She walked all the
way home.</p>

<p>But it was a composed and apparently happy
young woman who entered the Mallon house an
hour later. Her father had already returned, and
not even the fact that dinner had been delayed by
her tardiness could account for his air of excitement.</p>

<p>“Grace,” he said, “I was pleasantly surprised by
that young man, that Edwin Marmaduke. He is
no mere freak painter—he is a first-class commercial
artist. He doesn’t want it known, but—I should
never have guessed it, it is a tremendous joke on me—he
is the man who originated our ‘Try a Tin To-day’
posters! Did you know that?”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said Grace. “Is dinner ready?”</p>

<p>“It’s a fact,” said her father. “He showed me
the drawings. Of course, that changes things. I
told him to call this evening—how does that strike
you?”</p>

<p>Grace seemed passionately interested in her
grapefruit. She looked steadily at it as she answered.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I’m afraid I won’t be in this
evening. You see, I met David Watson on the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
home to-day, and he asked me to go to see ‘The
Boomerang’ with him to-night, and I said I’d go.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said her father. “Then I’d better telephone
Marmaduke to come to-morrow evening instead—or
will you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Grace serenely. “To-morrow night
won’t do, either. David is coming to call.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">SCENE</span>—<i>The living room of a six-room apartment.
On one side is a mahogany pianola; at
the back is a doorway with a heavy portière, drawn
aside to show a portion of the hall with a wall telephone.
At the right of the doorway is a life size
statue of a nude woman, the distance from her feet
to her waist being four times that from her waist to
her head, which is very small and has no features except
a prominent nose. Her arms are stretched out
at right angles to her body, and she has been painted
a vivid purple.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maxwell Johnson</span>, <i>a man of about thirty, is lying
in slippered ease on a chaise-longue, smoking a
cigar</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Johnson</span> <i>is seated facing him on the
bench by the pianola. She is a very pretty young
woman, rather too highly coloured, wearing an extremely
décolleté gown of pale green charmeuse, a
long string of large jade beads and a broad silver
bracelet. She has a profusion of bright yellow hair.
One knee is crossed over the other, revealing green
silk stockings and silver slippers.</i></p>

<p>But Anarchists don’t ride in automobiles, do they,
Nellie?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Max, I do wish you wouldn’t tease me about
things that are sacred. If you don’t want to get an
automobile, just say so, but don’t try to make fun
of things you can’t possibly understand!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>But, <span class="locked">Nellie—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>It’s hard enough for me to put up with your staying
home and lying around and reading the paper
while I go out night after night without you, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
wear myself out at the Settlement and the Ferrer
School and making speeches and addresses and
everything in the subway and back in it, and losing,
all the elation and social consciousness and everything,
without having Anarchism and beauty and
truth and everything that really means anything to
anybody who tries really to think just made a joke
of!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Good heavens, Nellie, I’m perfectly willing to
buy the automobile; and I’m not criticising any of
your hobbies! <span class="locked">I—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Hobbies! Does one wear one’s self out for a
hobby? Does one die for a hobby? Is the vote a
hobby? Is the Woman’s Movement a hobby? Is
Futurism a hobby? Is the Church of the Social
Revolution a hobby? Is preaching the great truths
of sex to one’s unborn children a hobby? <span class="locked">Is—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>All right, all right; let me slip in a word, won’t
you? I’m not knocking any of your—devotions.
I’ll get the automobile if you want it. I simply
want you to make up your mind whether you want
me to get it, or to use the two thousand for a bungalow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
at Amaranth, or wherever that crazy summer
colony is.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>It would be lovely to have our own place at
Amaranth—though I suppose you’d only come out
for weekends—you know it’s the most wonderful
place, with the most wonderful scenery, and only
really interesting people are allowed there, poets
and sculptors and people who really do things;
and there’s to be a pageant this summer and Lionel
Morris says he wants me to do my barefoot dance;
but I do wish we had a car—it would be wonderful
just to get into one’s own car all the time and go
anywhere, and I could take parties of interesting
people out on tours to Ellis Island and the Night
<span class="locked">Court—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>The Night Court! Yes, I think if you run the
car you will go on a tour to the Night Court pretty
soon, and you’ll have a special cop to take care of
you, too. But you decide to-night whether you
want the car or the bungalow, see? I’m game to
spend two thousand dollars on one or the other, but
you’ve got to decide. (<i>From the dining room comes
the loud clink of the steam radiator.</i>) There’s that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
radiator again! (<i>The telephone bell rings.</i>) And
there’s the ’phone! (<i>He goes into the dining room
and is heard muttering and pounding at the radiator,
which continues to clink.</i> <span class="smcap">Helen</span> <i>goes to the
telephone</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Hello!... Yes; what is it?... Yes, I am
Miss White. (<i>She turns and looks nervously
toward the dining room.</i>) Yes, this is Mrs. Johnson,
Sam. It’s all right; I know what he wants.
Tell Mr. Morris to come right up. (<span class="smcap">Helen</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> <i>reënter the living room at the same time.
The radiator still clinks, but less loudly, with longer
intervals of silence.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Max, Mr. Morris is coming up to take me to the
Mortons’ studio warming.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Studio warming, hey? Well, I’m going down to
get Ryan to come up and arrange a dining room
warming. It’s no use telephoning to him; he’ll just
promise to fix the radiator and then go back to his
chair and fall asleep. I’ll go down and drag him
up by the throat. (<i>He goes out through the hall
door, and is heard to open the outer door and speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
to someone.</i>) How are you, Mr. Morris? Walk
right in! The madam’s waiting for you.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span> (<i>off stage</i>)
</p>

<p>Ah, thank you, Mr. Johnson, thank you.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lionel</span>. <i>He is a handsome, slender
young man, very pale, with brown hair brushed
straight back.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span> (<i>lifting both of</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Johnson’s</span> <i>hands to
his lips</i>)
</p>

<p>Ah, Miss White! Dear Comrade White!</p>

<p>(<i>This hand-kissing and dearing business leads the
audience to think that</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Lionel Morris</span> <i>is the
villain of the play, a destroyer of homes, a desperate
character. As a matter of fact, he is nothing of the
sort. He is quite harmless, being a sociable young
man of limited education who likes to take part in
those radical movements which attract women. He
writes obscene poetry and paints pictures and makes
sculptures that would be disgusting if they were not
so funny. He is a rather interesting hybrid, being
part donkey and part tame cat.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Dear Comrade Lionel! See where I put your
“Emancipation of Woman.”</p>

<p>(<i>She leads him to the purple statue.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>Ah! I never can interest myself in any of my
work that is more than a day old. A poem or a picture
that I have made bores me when the first flush
of creation has passed. I feel toward it as I suppose
a father felt toward his children, in those
mediæval days when one had children. (<i>He touches
the outstretched hand of the statue.</i>) But, dear
Comrade White! Why do you make my “Emancipation
of Woman” live with a Hiroshige colour
print? A Toyokune I can endure, but a Hiroshige
absolutely spoils the melody of her composition.
Better the soft lyrical wall for a background, or perhaps
a simple hanging of passionate black satin.
Do you mind if I take this abomination down?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Surely, surely; you are always so right about
everything! Do change anything and everything
that will make it more comfortable for your wonderful
statue. She has meant so much to me since she
came....</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>I know, dear comrade.</p>

<p>(<i>He has moved the pianola bench to the wall and

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> (<i>as he leads</i> <span class="smcap">Ryan</span> <i>to the dining room</i>)
</p>

<p>Come in here, Ryan. Did you bring your
monkey wrench with you?</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Ryan</span> <i>mutters something unintelligible. They
go out into the dining room, from which come occasional
murmurs of conversation and sounds of
hammering.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span> (<i>from the pianola bench</i>)
</p>

<p>Do you know, I am not at all glad to see that
man.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Who? Max?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>No, indeed! That dreadful janitor! Do you
know, Miss White—that <span class="locked">janitor—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Don’t talk so loud! Max doesn’t like me to be
called “Miss White.” You know he’s funny and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
old-fashioned, and though he’s willing for me to be
a Feminist and to give money to the cause and
everything, it makes him positively rage to hear me
called “Miss White.” I tell him that a woman
doesn’t give up her soul and her name and everything
like a chattel mortgage just because she’s
married, but he says that I’ve got to be called “Mrs.
Johnson” because I’m no more Miss White than he
is.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span> (<i>getting down from the bench and putting
the colour print on the pianola</i>)
</p>

<p>Ah, well, he’ll wake up one of these days and
learn what Feminism really is. Even the business
men must wake up some time. There was a broker
that marched beside me in the suffrage parade this
year—a broker or a pawnbroker, I never know
which is which.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>But what about Ryan? Why don’t you like him?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>That janitor! Do you know, he is simply a degenerate!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>A degenerate? Like Lombroso?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>No. Worse than that. He actually has nine
children! Last week when I went around with
Comrade May Robinson Dannenberg and Comrade
Rebecca Idleheimer selling “Plain Facts about a
Great Evil” and working up enthusiasm for the suffrage
rally at the Church of the Social Revolution,
I made a special effort to interest the janitors and
their wives. We went into every basement from
here to 125th Street, and we saw some things that
made my heart bleed. And in the basement of this
very house I saw this man Ryan rocking a cradle
and drinking beer out of a tin pail. His wife was
cooking something disgusting on the gas stove and
nursing a baby with her left hand. Comrade May
Robinson Dannenberg was treated with absolute
discourtesy by them; in fact, the woman told her to
“go to hell”!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>But then, those people, you know, they never do
anything or read anything or anything. They are
just like animals.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>Yes, but you and I have got to keep them from
being animals! That’s what Social Consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
means. I won’t say duty—I hate the word—but
it’s your right to change the lives of those people
and you absolutely must exercise that right, just as
you absolutely must vote. There is that woman—a
woman, the creature of all our dreaming—(<i>He
points to the statue.</i>)—who might be out among the
fields and the trees and the brooks and the birds and
all the great and beautiful things of life, a sentient,
social being; and what is she? What do we find her
doing? Having a baby in a coalhole!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>I see what you mean. That dreadful janitor!
I know; I tried to get her to come to my class in the
Ferrer School, and she said she had too much work
to do.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>Exactly! Too much work to do! The thing that
has crushed the souls and spirits and hearts of women
throughout the generations! But we must stop
all this. You must stop it. You must speak to the
man—to <span class="locked">Ryan—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>I speak to Ryan? What shall I say to him? He
won’t come to the Ferrer School.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>The Ferrer School must come to him! You must
go to him and say: “Ryan, woman is no longer your
bond slave! You must have no more babies. You
are killing your wife with soul-deadening drudgery.
No janitor should have children; no janitor should
have a wife. You must put Mrs. Ryan in a model
tenement somewhere, and let her lead a normal, intellectual
life. Society will care for the children.
There are plenty of places where they can go and be
studied by scientists and develop, perhaps, into useful
members of the community. You will do your
work as before, but you must keep Mrs. Ryan away
from this drudgery somewhere where she can really
live her life.” Will you do this?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Why, yes, I suppose I ought to.... (<i>She
picks up her cloak which has been lying on a chair
and puts it on, with</i> <span class="smcap">Lionel’s</span> <i>assistance</i>.) It’s time
we started, isn’t it? But wait a minute! Max!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> (<i>coming in from the dining room</i>)
</p>

<p>Going? I hope you have a good time.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Yes, we’re going, but, Max, I want you to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
something for me. You know Ryan better than I
do and you can talk to him. Mr. Morris says that
he’s been abusing his wife, and he thinks we ought
to get him to put her into a model tenement where
she can develop her soul. He’s been overworking
her and all that sort of thing, so you talk to him
about it, will you? Mr. Morris knows a place where
she can go, and we can put the children somewhere,
and he can go on with his work, and it will be better
for everybody. So you talk to him about it, will
you?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Ryan? Abusing Mrs. Ryan? Good heavens, I
had no idea of this. Of course I’ll talk to him about
it. I’ll put a stop to that, Nellie. Good-bye. Enjoy
yourself. And you talk over that plan of ours
with Mr. Morris and decide whether you want a
bungalow or an automobile.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p>(<i>They go out.</i> <span class="smcap">Ryan</span> <i>comes in from the dining
room</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>I guess that radiator’ll be all right now, Mr.
Johnson. There was a lot of air in the pipe and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
valve was rusted tight, so I had a little trouble loosening
it up.</p>

<p>(<i>He starts out.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> (<i>frowning and looking at the floor</i>)
</p>

<p>Wait a minute, Ryan. I want to talk to you
about something. (<span class="smcap">Ryan</span> <i>comes toward him and
stands waiting</i>.) Ryan, I hear—don’t you think—er—will
you have a cigar?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Why, yes, thanks.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> <i>goes into the dining room and brings
out a humidor. He places it by the lamp on the
table and opens it. Both men take cigars and light
them.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Ryan, what I want to talk to you about is the way
in which you—it’s about what I hear about the way
you—Sit down, sit down!</p>

<p>(<i>He sits on the chaise-longue and</i> <span class="smcap">Ryan</span>, <i>looking
somewhat puzzled, sits on a chair on the other side
of the table</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>What was it you want to see me about, Mr. Johnson?
Any complaint?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Oh, no, not at all! Or, rather, yes, I have a complaint.
It’s rather a hard thing. I must say I’m
surprised to hear about the way you treat your wife.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span> (<i>rising from his chair</i>)
</p>

<p>What are you trying to give me? You <span class="locked">mind—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Now, that’s all right, Ryan; I’m not trying to
start anything. I’ve lived in this apartment for five
years and you know me. But they’ve been telling
me that you don’t treat your wife right, and I
thought I’d tell you about it.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Anybody that told you that, Mr. Johnson, is a
liar, I don’t care if it’s man, woman or child.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Now, Ryan, will you just listen to me for a
minute? This thing was sort of put up to me, and
I’ve got to do it. Probably these people are all
wrong. Just sit down and talk to me a minute.
Have a drink?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span> (<i>sulkily, sitting down again</i>)
</p>

<p>Yes, thanks. (<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> <i>brings in from the dining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
room a bottle, a siphon and two glasses</i>.) Ain’t
you got any ice?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Oh, yes, that’s right.</p>

<p>(<i>He goes into the dining room again and comes
back with a plate of cracked ice. Meanwhile</i> <span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
<i>pockets several cigars and pours a generous portion
of whiskey into the glasses</i>. <span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> <i>sits down
again, and as the men talk they drink, refilling their
glasses from time to time</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Now just what did these fresh guys say about me,
Mr. Johnson? You know there’s such a thing as a
libel law in these here United States.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Well, I’ll tell you, Ryan. I don’t know whether
there’s anything in it or not, and these people may
have it all wrong, but they said that you were treating
Mrs. Ryan very badly.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>I beat her up, I suppose?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>No, they didn’t say anything like that. It’s this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
way, Ryan: These people are making a sort of special
study of people that work hard for a living, and
they say—I don’t know whether they’re right or not—that
you’re not treating Mrs. Ryan right to make
her work so hard and have so many children and all
that sort of thing.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson, if any man but you was talking
to me like that, I’d knock his block off, the big boob!
Why, whose business is it how many children I
have? What do they expect she’s going to do? Lie
on a couch an’ have me bring her ice cream all day
long? I been married thirteen years next month,
an’ if anybody wants to know how I treat my wife
I refer them to her, I do.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Well, Ryan, as I said, I’m inclined to think that
these people that were talking to me were a bit
hasty. But see here; listen to me a minute. These
people want to do you a good turn. You’ll admit,
I suppose, that it isn’t the finest life in the world for
Mrs. Ryan to be staying down there in the basement
all day and all night washing clothes and cooking
meals and tending to the children. She’s sick every
now and then, isn’t she?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Now and then.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Well, the idea is this: These people are what they
call philanthropists—that is, they’re trying to make
the world better, to make people happier. Now,
they’ve built a very nice tenement house; it’s called
a model tenement; it’s almost as good an apartment
house to live in as this one. What they say is, that
you can put Mrs. Ryan there, in a nice suite of
rooms, with hot and cold water and a bathroom and
electric light and everything for very little money—say
five dollars a week. You can come there to
sleep nights and you can get your breakfast and
supper there with her in what they call the community
dining room. You see, they do all the cooking
for you and charge you just what the food costs for
the meals. Your wife won’t have any more cooking
to do, and they’ll give you better meals in that dining
room than you’ve ever had before, believe me.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>I see. What about the washing?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Well, they have a big laundry in the place and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
all your washing for you for about half what a regular
laundry would cost you. That sounds like a
pretty good thing, doesn’t it?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>A pretty good thing, and I suppose there’s nursemaids
and governesses for all the children, too, hey?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Why, as a matter of fact there are—but not exactly
in the way you mean. You see, they run a sort
of a boarding school, too, the people that run this
model tenement do, and they take care of all the
children there—keep ’em night and day, feed ’em
and dress ’em and teach ’em trades and all that sort
of thing. They let them come to see you on Sunday,
but you’re relieved of all responsibility and
your wife of all the trouble.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>I see. But what’s to become of my job when
I’m going off to this here model tenement to sleep
nights? Don’t you know that a janitor has to sleep
in the building he’s taking care of?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Well, you’re not in love with your job, are you?
You’d be willing to do some other work where there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
was a chance of advancement and better pay,
wouldn’t you?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Sure I would. Where am I going to get it?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Why, as to that, I guess Mr. Morris or I could
get you a job somewhere. You’re a big husky fellow
and pretty steady, I know. I could get you a job in
the shipping department of a factory I am interested
in, if you wanted it.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>What would the hours be?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> (<i>laughing</i>)
</p>

<p>Why, you’re going pretty fast, Ryan. I don’t
know just what the hours would be yet, but I suppose
they’d be from half past eight to six or something
like that. That’s easier than your hours now,
isn’t it?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Much easier. Now, what has all this got to do
with my wife having too many children?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Why, these people think that Mrs. Ryan has had
too many children. Some of these people are doctors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
and they say it’s bad for a woman’s health to
have so many children.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>I see. Well, what would you like to have me do
about it?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>About the model tenement?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>No, about my wife having any more children.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Well, you know—you see I’m not—what they
think is— Oh, damn it, I don’t know about this
part of the thing, Ryan. It’s out of my line. I’m
not a philanthropist. I’m just talking for these
people because they know I know you. About that
question you’ll have to talk to Mrs. Dannenberg or
Mr. Morris.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Mr. Morris—he’s the little guy that was standing
on a chair when I came in to-night, ain’t he?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Is he a doctor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>No, I don’t think he is.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>He came into my place the other day selling some
sort of a little doctor book.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>I know; he does that because he’s a philanthropist.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Do people make a living by being philanthropists?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>No—well, as a matter of fact, many people do
make a pretty fat living out of it, but Mr. Morris
doesn’t. He’s a sculptor—a man that makes statues,
you know.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Oh, I know what a sculptor is, all right. What
statues did Mr. Morris make?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Why, he made that statue over in the corner, for
one thing.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Ryan</span> <i>goes over and examines the purple
statue</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Do you like this statue, Mr. Johnson?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> (<i>laughing</i>)
</p>

<p>I’m not a judge of such things, Ryan. But people
who know about art say that it’s very good indeed.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Is it a good likeness?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>It’s not supposed to be a portrait; it’s a sort of a
fancy statue. It represents the “Emancipation of
Woman”—woman freed, you know.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Freed from what?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Why, from overwork, and excessive child-bearing
and all that sort of thing, you know.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Well, that lady’s freed from child-bearing, all
right. She’s perfectly safe on that score. (<i>He
goes back to his chair and pours out another drink.</i>)
But now let’s get back to your friends’ proposition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
I’m to get a day job and come home nights—is that
right?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>The children are taken off my wife’s hands, and
she doesn’t have to do any more cooking or washing
or anything, hey?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>That’s it, Ryan.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>And the place we’d live would be pretty much
like this apartment, would it?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Just as comfortable, at any rate.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>My wife would have no work to do; I’d work in
the daytime and come home nights—there’d be no
kids to take care of—it would be pretty much like
the life that you and your wife have, wouldn’t it,
Mr. Johnson?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Ah—why, yes, Ryan, pretty much the same.
What do you think of the proposition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Well, I’ll tell you. Of course I wouldn’t like to
have the children go away—though they are a lot
of trouble—but I suppose they’d be better taken
care of than we could do, so, if that was all there
was to it, I’d say go ahead. And it’d be all right
for me, too, if I was a bachelor. But it’s on account
of my wife that I feel I’ve got to say, “Excuse me!”</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Why, you don’t begrudge your wife a little rest,
do you, Ryan?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Would I begrudge the old woman a little rest?
Yes, by God, I would, if a little rest meant having
nothing to do all day except sit around and talk to
her friends and run around town. It’s just on that
account that I say nix to your whole proposition.
Now you think I’m a slave driver, I suppose.
Well, I ain’t, Mr. Johnson, but I’ve lived with a
woman thirteen years, and what I’m telling you I
didn’t get out of no books—it’s facts!</p>

<p>Listen, Mr. Johnson. What you want us to do
is to live just the sort of life that you and your wife
live—no children to take care of, no washing nor
cooking nor nothing. Well, what I say is, excuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
me! That may be all right for you and your wife—she
don’t need no housework nor children nor
nothing to keep her busy. Her time is full of all
sorts of useful things—I know that. (<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
<i>stirs uneasily and looks at the floor</i>.) But with
Annie, my wife, it’s a different proposition altogether.
She’s one of them women—and there’s a
lot more of them than you think—that can’t stand
living in a nice regular apartment with nothing to
do. I know because we tried it when we was first
married. It’s like what the old fellow said: “Satan
finds some mischief still for idle hands to do”!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>True enough! <span class="locked">And—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Listen, Mr. Johnson. When we was first married,
Annie was one of these here idle hands they
tell of. She was an idle hand for three years, and
Satan, as the old fellow said, certainly found some
mischief for her to do. Not anything real bad—there’s
no real harm in Annie—but it was mischief
all right. For the first three years we was living in
a nice apartment in Brooklyn. I wasn’t a janitor,
then; I was driving a truck. I was out all day and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
I got home every night at six or seven o’clock. All
Annie has to do is to get my breakfast and supper
and keep the place clean. Does she do it? Sure she
does, for the first four or five weeks! Then she gets
to making friends with other women in the building
and going out to matinees and vaudeville and all
that sort of thing. That’s all right—I can afford
it—I don’t care if she has a good time; but then
what does she do? I give her two dollars in the
morning to go out and buy a good supper for me
when I come home. I come home and she ain’t in
yet, and the lady in the next flat gives me the
groceries that she’s sent home. And what is they?
A little chipped beef and a box of Saratoga chips
and some baker’s bread. About fifty-cent’s worth.
When she gets home I ask her where she’s been.
Why, Mrs. Eindorfer has took her to a spiritualist
meeting, and she’s spent the rest of that money to
look into a glass ball or have her fortune told or
some such foolishness.</p>

<p>Now this goes on for nearly three years. It ain’t
all spiritualists’ meetings; it’s all sorts of things.
She makes all sorts of friends, women and men, too;
I had to beat a couple of ’em up. The flat wasn’t
kept up; I run into debt; my meals wasn’t cooked
right or on time, and Annie was half sick all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
time just from running around entertaining herself.
I ain’t blaming her. She wasn’t to blame. And
what was to blame? The apartment house was to
blame. When Peter was born, after we’d been married
three years, and I gave up trucking and moved
out of that apartment house and got a job as
janitor, everything was all right. And everything’s
been all right ever since.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>)
</p>

<p>And the apartment house was to blame?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Believe me, Mr. Johnson, the only part of an
apartment house to live in is the basement, where
you can have a regular home. I been a janitor for
ten years, and I seen these apartment houses do
queer things to families. They don’t seem to have
no children when they live in apartment houses,
that’s one thing. And there ain’t no coal to bring
up and the washing goes out, and there ain’t nothing
for them to do but just make fools of themselves.
And sometimes there’s a good many divorces been
caused by these here apartment houses. And
there’d be a good many more divorces if a lot of
husbands knew what went on when they was downtown
at business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p>Understand me, Mr. Johnson. I don’t mean you
and your wife at all. You ain’t that sort of people,
but what I do say is for my wife, and for a lot of
women with more education and more money than
she’s got, the only sort of life is doing housework
and taking care of children all day long. So Annie
and me will stay down in the basement, much
obliged to you, unless we go out of New York to
live in a little house in the country sometime. And
Annie’ll have just as much work to do there. She’s
one of them women that wasn’t meant to be idle.
And now I guess I’ll go downstairs.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>

<p>Ryan, I—er—why, I guess you’re right, after
all. I’ll tell my friends what you said.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>All right. No hard feelings, I hope.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Not at all; that’s all right. Good night, Ryan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Ryan</span>
</p>

<p>Good night, Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>(<i>He goes out.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>There’s a man that’s master in his own home, at
any rate. (<i>He lights a cigar and walks around the
room with his hands in his trousers pockets, coming

<p>(<span class="smcap">Helen</span> <i>sobs without answering</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>It’s those nasty Martins and that nasty policeman
and that nasty Lionel Morris.</p>

<p>(<i>The bell rings again.</i> <span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> <i>goes to the

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span>
</p>

<p>Oh, I’m awfully glad you got back all right, Miss
White. I jumped into a taxi as soon as that brute
of a policeman came, and then I met all the rest of
the crowd at the studio and everybody said,
“Where’s Miss White?” So I came right up here
to find out if you’d got home.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>For God’s sake, will somebody tell me what’s
happened?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lionel</span> (<i>sitting on the pianola bench</i>)
</p>

<p>Why, you <span class="locked">see—</span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Helen</span>
</p>

<p>Be still. You see, Max, we were all at the Mortons’
studio, and Adrian Wolfe made a speech
about those nasty striking miners in California or
wherever it is that everybody is wearing mourning
for and parading and all that and this—and Mr.
Morris said: “Let’s walk up to Union Square and
hold an open air meeting to protest.” So we went
up there and I made a speech and there was a crowd
and I saw a policeman there, but I thought it would
be all right, and then Mr. Morris made a speech and
he said something about trampling on a bloodstained
flag, and the policeman told him to stop, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
he called the policeman a myrmidon, and some more
policemen came and broke up the meeting, and he
ran away and wouldn’t help me; and I ran down
into the subway, and I don’t see how he dares show
his face in here!</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>I’ll talk to him presently, but quiet down a little.
You’d better go in your room and fix up your hair.</p>

<p>I won’t go to that nasty Amaranth this summer,

<p>No, you won’t go to Amaranth.</p>

<p class="center">

<p>Then will you get an automobile?</p>

<p>No, I won’t get an automobile.</p>

<p>Then <span class="locked">what—</span></p>

<p class="center">

<p>I am going to take that two thousand dollars and
buy, with the assistance of the building and loan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
association, a small house in a city called Joplin, in
the State of Missouri. It will not be a large house,
but I think that you will not find the time hanging
heavy on your hands. My brother has a wholesale
grocery there, and I dare say he will take me
into the business, especially as I have a little money
to invest. And I’ll come home to luncheon every
day. Missouri is a fertile State. My brother has
six children.</p>

<p>What—what do you mean?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>It’s the janitor. Yes, Ryan, the fellow down in
the basement with nine children that you and Mrs.
What’s-her-name wanted to segregate. He told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
all about you to-night. You’re nothing but a by-product!
The apartment house is the real devil in
this pretty little play—the apartment house is responsible
for Feminism and Socialism and Anarchism
and Eugenics and pups like you. You’re just
a sort of bad substitute for the movies—that’s all
you are. The apartment house breeds the whole
bunch of you—the apartment house and its artificial,
lazy, good-for-nothing life.</p>

<p>Well, that’s all right, then. There’s a cop down-stairs

think that Morris’s taxicab stopped at this building,

<p>Oh, I was just thinking of the janitor. I had
quite a talk with him after you left.</p>

<p>(<i>The doorbell rings, and</i> <span class="smcap">Maxwell</span> <i>admits a
large policeman</i>.)</p>

<p>Excuse me, sir; it’s just a matter of form. I’m

bugs. It’s just a matter of form. The
man’s name is Lionel Morris and the woman’s name
is Helen White. Are you Lionel Morris?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>No; my name is Maxwell Johnson. The janitor
knows me, and so do a lot of people in the building.</p>

<p>Thank you, sir. It’s just a matter of form.
Now, madam—it’s just a matter of form—are you
Helen White?</p>

<p class="center">

<p>Thank you, madam, thank you; it’s just a matter

<p>No, Helen White is not here.</p>

<p>And I’m glad she isn’t here, officer.</p>

<p>You may well be that, sir; you may well be that.
Now, is Lionel Morris here?</p>

<p>(<i>There is a pause, during which the purple statue
shakes slightly.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>
</p>

<p>Well, what do you think about it, officer? Take
a look around the place. Want to look in the dumb
waiter or down the kitchen sink?</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Policeman</span>
</p>

<p>Oh, I know he’s not here, Mr. Johnson, and I’m
sorry to have troubled you. Much obliged to you.
Good night, sir.</p>
